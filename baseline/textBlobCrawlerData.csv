This is misleading. The person in question in the news article was operating as a business specifically to buy crypto.  
Banks are not closing personal accounts, these news reports are about business accounts. Unless the business meets certain regulatory requirements, it's understandable that the banks would close the account.
How is this surprising? The response is a bit melodramatic. Maybe they should ask for an explanation tomorrow rather than tweeting their speculations. The SMH article is short on detail but appears to suggest AU banks are not happy dealing with these Btc exchanges. Again, not overly surprising given that the exchanges are offshore and aren't financial institutions.

Edit: So all 4 are privately owned companies, none are financial institutions nor registered with the local regulator (2 are in the UK and aren't registered with the FSA)

I mean, who are you to cry about it when the very authorities and institutions you are so hard about trying to stick it to exercise the only move that hits you where it hurts- in your access to the actual state-backed currencies! Y'know, the only thing y'all seem interested in with your internet monopoly money... nevermind the idealistic aspirations of bitcoin to be some kind of all-boats-lifting silver bullet, all you care about is using it to get access to bigger and bigger amounts of actual currency.

I wish the ethnoreligious argument had no place in the 21st century. Ever notice how theists try to confuse the boundary between race and religion in order to insinuate that they're right? I bet the religious belief that they're ""chosen"" has nothing to do with it.  /s

The God belief itself is the problem here. Rather than making an argument for reason, both sides are deferring to an almighty and irreconcilable authority. One that maintains racial boundaries and justifies prejudice based on 2000 year old conjecture. Its time to separate race from religion and tell these people straight up that they're being stupid. And fuck antisemitism and Islamophobia. You're both wrong.  There is no such thing as God, and having different views, especially evidence based views does not constitute prejudice. On the contrary, religion is a vehicle for corruption and misinformation. Anything can be reasoned in the name of an absolute, infallible imaginary friend. These texts don't make sense to begin with. They're historically inaccurate and filled with blood shed and contradictions. They're not supposed to make sense. Instead they're a repertoire for cyclical logic so that any authority can rely on appeals to emotion to enforce anything they see fit. And we wonder why corruption is endemic in the Middle East. Its time to stop being pussies and point to the real culprit. A 2000+ year old pyramid scheme that places con artists and snake oil salesmen on top.

For those still confused about the ethics of the hijab, Maajid Nawaz put it well: 

> Mandatory hijab is a patriarchal &misogynist instrument of control. As a liberal, I support *legal choice* to wear it, but still *intellectually &morally oppose* it everywhere for what it represents (just like the confederate flag)
If that lady was a loner in a time with no protests going on she would sure as hell be in trouble.
I live in a Western country, and the other day I saw a Muslim family of three in the park. The young girl (daughter) was with a face covering on - her mother was wearing a burkha, and of course the father was dressed casually, like anyone else. What was immediately obvious, as indicated by the youthfulness of the girl, was that she was being told to wear the face covering, so encapsulated in this whole image was the deprivation of the young girls autonomy, her ability to choose her own religion or lack of religion. For me, it really spoke to the notion that religion can make ordinary people (from my limited knowledge the family looked cordial and harmonious) do otherwise questionable things. 

I don't mean to single out Islam, my mentioning of the example just arose because of the nature of the article, and my own anecdote. Because the point stands for religiously motivated Circumcision and the taking of ones child to church every week as well. 

Edit: A person accused me of pulling an ""assumption out of my arse"" by assuming that girl wasn't making a choice. I responded to his comment individually, however I feel as though this comment will be seen more than my reply, so I will paste my reply here too. 

In an essence I said: Please, don't be disingenuous. But let's pretend that you're right, and these parents sat down with their child and weighed out, in depth, all the possible arguments for and against Islam, and then gave her a choice (I admit, it's possible). That still doesn't take away from the wider fact, that this deprivation of choice does happen, and occurs all around the world, and you will never be able to challenge that, because that is a hardened fact.

""hate speech, fake news and illegal material""

What could possibly go wrong you guys?
Reddit? Half of /r/all is bullshit good luck with that one.
Looks damn near impossible to accurately and effectively enforce, I'm not familiar with German laws but this seems like wishful thinking.
This is fucking pathetic. Germany is litteraly creating a thought-police program and people are just ignoring it.

I doubt this will get to /r/all.
if you don't have free speech your country is not a democracy.
Social Media companies should just exit Germany entirely.

It's a planet of 7-8 billion people, the policies of one particular country shouldn't be able to create administrative chaos.

Block german users, pull down german translations of popular social media apps, and put ""This Site/Service Is Not Available In Your Country.""

Problem solved. 
Eh personally i oppose any kind of regulation of speech law. People should be freed to voice their beliefs, no matter how ignorant or offensive, and they should be free to be ridiculed for them. But they should not be prevented from voicing their beliefs in the first place.
Wonder how that applies to religious preachings
Good evening from Germany, reddit.  
I have translated the content of the *Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz* (NetzDG) into English for you to read.  
 My source is [gesetze-im-internet.de](http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/netzdg/BJNR335210017.html), a platform provided by the federal ministry of justice.  
Please note that **I AM NOT A LAWYER AND HAVE NO LEGAL BACKGROUND WHATSOEVER**, so take everything in here with a ~~grain~~ pile of salt. If I have missed or mistranslated something, **please correct me**.     
All emphasis added by me. *Italics* denote a legal term.

1. Affected by this law are for-profit companies' platforms which allow users to create and share own content, referred to as *social networks*. Exempt are platforms for whose journalistic content the company alone is responsible, or ones with less than 2 million users in Germany.
2. Defined as *illegal content* for the scope of this law is content that violates  
  -  §86 StGB (spreading anti-constitutional propaganda)
  -  §86a StGB (usage of anti-constitutional symbols)
  -  §89a StGB (as far as I understand it preparation for acts of terrorism)
  -  §91 StGB (spreading material encouraging or assisting to commit acts of terrorism - see 89a)
  -  §100a StGB (*treasonous forgery*)
  -  §111 StGB (call to commit a crime)
  -  §126 StGB (disturbing the public peace by threatening to commit a crime)
  -  §129-§129b StGB (establishing a criminal/terrorist organization)
  -  §130 StGB (*Volksverhetzung* -> inciting hate against ethnic/religious groups or a member of such a group because of his membership in that group **in such a way that the public peace is threatened** - see /u/Karranor's comment below)
  -  §131 StGB (creating/sharing material that consists of trivialization or glorification of violence against humans or human-like beings)
  -  §140 StGB (rewarding or endorsing crimes in such a way that the public peace is threatened)
  -  §166 StGB (insulting religions or ""world-view associations"" in such a way that the public peace is threatened)
  -  §184b,d StGB (creation of, possession of and spreading child pornography)
  -  §185-187 StGB (insult and defamation)
  -  §201a StGB (violating someones' personal living sphere by photographing them or spreading such an image)
  -  §241 StGB (threatening to commit a crime)
  -  §269 StGB (forgery of evidence)
3. A *social network* receiving more than 100 complaints per year is required to publish a biannual report in German detailing how they deal with *illegal content*.
4. A *social network* is required to have a process for dealing with *illegal content*.
5. A *social network* is required to easily permit users to submit complaints on *illegal content*.
6. That process is required to 
  - check whether content **that they receive a complaint** about is illegal and therefore to be removed or have access to it restricted
  - remove obviously *illegal content* within 24 hours unless the *social network* has negotiated a longer timespan to do so
  - remove or restrict access to *illegal content* within seven days unless:
     - if the illegality(?) of the content depends on the wrongness of a statement of fact, then the user is allowed to make a statement to the complaint
     - if the *social network* outsources decisions to an approved entity of self-regulation and adheres to their judgment
  - save content in case of removal for purposes of evidence, according to some EU guidelines I didn't bother to read
  - inform both the submitter of the complaint and the user of their actions
7. A *social network* is required to monthly check on the effectiveness of their process and remove all administrative problems with it, the ""judges"" are required to receive at least biannual training and counseling.
8. *Approved entities of self-regulation* (see 6.) are required to
  - Have independent and competent judges
  - Be able to process complaints within seven days
  - Be sustained by companies or institutions that provide proper equipment
  - Be open to other *social networks* joining them  
They are approved by the federal office of justice.
9. The approval for entities of self-regulation can be retracted if they fail to comply to their requirements.
10. The federal office of justice is allowed to bar *social networks* from outsourcing their decisions if it is expected for them to fail to comply to the entities' judgment.
11. It is an offense to
  - fail to have a process dealing with complaints
  - fail to produce an complete report on time (see 3.)
  - fail to do monthly checks on their process or to remove problems with it (see 7.)
  - fail to provide training or counseling (see 7.)  
Those are punishable with a fine up to 50 million euro (5m according to the text, but it refers to another law allowing tenfold increase of the maximum fine)
  - fail to appoint a representative to German courts
  - fail to respond to inquiries by German courts regarding spreading of illegal content within 48 hours.  
Those are punishable with a fine up to 5 million euro (500k according to the text, but it refers to another law allowing tenfold increase of the maximum fine)    

**Closing remark of mine:**  
This law is heavily contested in Germany (in my news sources at least), and I personally expect it to be put down sooner or later by either a new government or our federal constitutional court. While it clearly endangers free speech online by causing platform operators to possibly over-remove content, it is also very distant from any kind of ""thought police"" that some people read into it.   
Thanks for reading.

There is no such thing as a strong Europe. If he is trying to make Europe into another united States then it will never happen. There are too many cultural and language differences to ever make that work.
True, and the same goes for any other European country. What most Europeans fail to realize is that the days of the big European nations are long over. Taken alone, both politically and economically, European countries are little more than irrelevant and have no leverage. On the other hand, if they would put aside their dick-measuring contests and unite they would represent the strongest economic power on earth. 
But that takes maturity...

I was in Costa Rica last June and took a few Nature Air flights because they're insanely cheap. They weigh you and your bags before getting on the plane to ensure they were under the weight limits.

It was the scariest flight of my life. Literally the entire flight I heard the ""Terrain. Pull up!"" alarm, as I was sitting just behind the (open aside from a short divider) cockpit. I have watched a _lot_ of episodes of Mayday and Seconds from Disaster, and nothing good ever comes from that warning. I was waiting to die for the whole flight. We were so low for the whole flight, I didn't know it was even possible to fly below the clouds for a commercial flight.  
I bet this plane was overweight and coupled with thin mountain it is a tragedy in the making. Here is a good example of this kind of accident with luckily a much better [outcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDu0jYiz-v8)

When will Germany properly stop using very unclean coal, I love how Germany says it is so green yet it uses a shit ton of coal and is blocking imports of solar cells from china and other countries meaning that solar energy is more expensive
Well renewable energy is still considerably more expensive than existing nuclear power. But it doesnt really matter. Renewables need a dispatchable backup like hydro, coal or nuclear. And nuclear is the cheapest of those three.

I suppose the answer is to bring in foreign workers from other countries that are grossly overpopulated. 

I wouldn't though. Japan enjoys a rich culture. I would like to go there and experience it without being watered down by other cultures. I'm sure technology will solve their top heavy population problem with robot care givers.

$72 million is a lot of propaganda.

Teva is crashing all on its own, and what with biology and demographics working as they should BDS  may even be no longer necessary, but just as a moral and ethical thing, I will go on supporting it and opposing AIPAC backdoor bribery.
So basically Israel will  continue to pay the bulk of BDS PR costs ? Working great for them so far if you look at the recent UN Vote. /s 
Interesting, 72, like the number of Demons that King Solomon ruled:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_Key_of_Solomon#The_Seventy-Two_Demons
This is reason enough to support BDS. 
I mean if you cannot discredit them on your own then you may want to recheck your education background

But go to a job interview and talk about how evil Israel is and how you won’t use Israeli products (you all are), I’m sure it will go well

They must have blocked internet and text messaging for awhile because I couldn't get through to any of my relatives yesterday. Finally one messaged me who I know uses VPN, but all he wanted to do was talk about his coming birthday party ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
It is funny how Western people condemn any protestors in Western countries (such as the US) if, during a protest, they break a small window of a store of a corporation who is responsible for enslaving hundreds of millions of children in sweatshops, causing the death of millions through toxic dumping and environmental damage, and lobbying the government to pass through laws that make life harder for the average American, just so the CEO can get his 72nd yacht, yet when protestors burn entire buildings in a country with a government that does not bend over to the Western banking cartel to go in and install their corporations which sell unnecessary garbage to people, and enslaven children into sweatshops, then everybody says that they should continue with such a violence. 

All I can say is the ""law"" is created by the powerful, and should common sense not prevail?. If breaking a window or burning a building is necessary to change a horrible and murderous system, then should the window not be broken only for the purposes of upholding the law that the powerful wrote? 
And he is right. Using violence when protesting is absolutely retarded. First off because it de-legitimizes the protest. Second you're giving the police (or whoever is monitoring) an excuse to use violence in kind. Third because EVERY SINGLE PERSON is paying for the broken public property. Fourth because you don't want escalation,ever.
Rouhani was involved in purging tens of thousands of anti-islamic dissidents in the 80s. The idea he's some moderate is laughable.
I hate to say it but I agree with him. I despise the Iranian government's rules and regulations since its islamic revolution but he is speaking truthfully.
Every established modern government on earth uses this same crowd control policy to squash dissent.  Except for the ones who tolerate no protests at all - and don’t feel the need to publicly justify killing or jailing dissenters and protesters.  

Even the most tolerant democracies will call out police and/or military if a large crowd of demonstrators are perceived as “becoming violent” or start damaging property.  This often leads to an escalation and injuries/death.  It can frequently be a label that is assigned when the government wants to end the demonstration and needs political “cover” to justify the use of force against protesters.  

“The mob turned violent and were committing criminal acts endangering the public! We had no choice but to open fire on the hooligans in order to restore peace and civil order for the common good of the people.” 

(And we needed to discredit those who disagree with the current leadership, and stop what could otherwise threaten our party/policy/leadership.)

> President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday Iranians had the right to protest and criticise the government but their actions should not lead to violence or damage public property.

> ""Iranians understand the sensitive situation of Iran and region and will act based on their national interests.""

>Rouhani rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump's comments in support of the protests and said ""those who called Iranians terrorists have no business sympathizing with our nation.""

[This twitter thread from Reza Khasteh translates what Rouhani said in his statement.](https://twitter.com/Khaaasteh/status/947521192864485378)

Basically, he has minimized discontent for the government and turned it into ""oh, it's just people dissatisfied with their economic situation"".  He has shifted the blame from the Supreme Leader and himself to ""government officials"" for  *not importing the eggs sooner and informing the Iranian people of the higher egg prices, causing unrest.* No word yet on who these government officials are that he is criticizing, just a pathetic attempt at shifting the blame away from himself and his government.

He is also towing the ""foreign intervention"" line that other people have been concerned about, speculating that foreign powers are waiting to take advantage of these protests. Although that is almost certainly true, this is a repeat of the government rhetoric in 2009, where the Supreme Leader blamed the US and Israel for causing the election protests and supporting them.

Where do the protests go from here? I don't know. There was no special event that triggered these protests, it's hard to tell how quickly they will fizz out. If more protesters are killed, it may prolong the protests significantly, but we can't say to what extent.
And bullets. They must avoid bullets.

I remember this story popped up the day after it was reported that Russia was fueling North Korea. Fun little give and take we have going on. Ukraine is definitely the way to get Russia attention
Pointless as they are so fucking expensive to use though, only worth it in actual high intensity wars against main battle tanks, not irregular wars against old Soviet gear.

It's something like 80k per  **round** compared to 5k or so for a Milan or some other widely available 1980s system like Swingfire.
This doesn't change the equation. It's nice for political reasons, boosts -- as the article says -- the Ukrainian Army's morale but that's it. Regardless how many new weapons the Ukrainian Army would receive from abroad, Russia can match anything tenfold and if the Ukrainian command feels revitalized and tries once again to take control of the Donbass by force they will once again be taught a brutal lesson and would only lose more land to the Donbass Republics.

(Asked in another thread, but no reply so far, so I'll try my luck here)

Serious question: Does South Korea has the right to seize ships that's trading with North Korea? 

Let's say a ship is traveling to North Korea without entering South Korean's water, does South Korea has the right to seize that ship? What happened to the seized ship?

If I recall correctly, UN Sanction is not binding. That means, South Korea aren't legally allowed to seize any ship that's trading with the sanctioned country.

Correct me if I'm wrong.
Panama is not China. Trump was a bit quick with the Twitter trigger finger on this one. He should try harder to avoid alienating our allies in the Eastern Theater of this proxy war.
While the first ship was registered in China (Hong Kong) it was being leased by a private firm from Taiwan.

So why is Trump blaming China?
If America did this sort of stuff the Russian bot farms would be brigading the shit out of this of evidence of US imperialism. But because it’s Russia and China it’s almost like we expect them to flaunt international law
It's not a row, it's a sanction.
Just seize and scrap every ship that does that.

How is 'favorable winds' a way to battle smog?
This is a fascinating subject with a lot to consider.

In winter, cold air from the Siberian Anticyclone is just constantly pouring through Northeast China toward the Pacific. It's carrying a lot of dust from the Loess Plateau, in part because it is undergoing severe erosion but [people are working on fixing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QUSIJ80n50).

Combine this with the heavy coal consumption and you have a lot of particulate matter.

Luckily Beijing is not really in the perfect physical setting for temperature inversions (compared to the [Sichuan Basin](http://maps.maphill.com/china/sichuan/maps/physical-map/physical-map-of-sichuan.jpg)). They still have them, just less often. For this reason I think we'll see a faster recovery in air quality there. Just a hunch.
I’ve been in China for 3 weeks and I haven’t stopped coughing. Those ‘favourable’ winds just blow the heavy smog into rural areas with no industry. 

Standing on the peak of a snowy mountain surrounded by Inner Mongolian desert the other day, visibility was down to like 30% due to smog which had no apparent source.
Good to hear there's some progress to be made, if the rapidly growing powers of China and India can solve urban pollution, many other developing nations will follow suite saying thousands of lives from pollution 
I sure hope they really have turned the tide in a positive direction.

You cannot hold back tge winds of destiny forever. People will get what they want in the end. Freedom and the common good of mankind is something we all strive for.
I just don't see the protestors winning. As I predicted, some people would get killed, and then the protests would die down, as was the case in 2009. The only way that people would continue to risk their lives is if the economy keeps getting even worse, to the point that people decide that they have nothing to lose. But that is unlikely. Iran's government is similar to China (and pretty much everywhere, including the US.. don't forget peaceful occupy wall street protesters were violently removed... there is no doubt that the US would use the military against their people if their people did what the Iranian protesters are doing right now and the capitalists who run and control the US felt existentially threatened) in that it would kill as many people as required to preserve the establishment: they have specifically said that ""we will not make the same mistake as the Shah."" The Shah killed many protesters, but after a while he just couldn't do it anymore and fled: one of his advisors pleaded with him to use as much force as necessary in order to prevent the revolution but the Shah said he did not have the stomach for it and fled instead. The IRGC are there to protect the establishment, and many of them have turned into a corrupt oligarchy, amassing much of the nation's wealth, so they have a personal economic incentive to safeguard the establishment (even if they do not believe in its ideology), just like the elite capitalists in the West want to prolong the life of the capitalist system and did not support the occupy wall street movement. 

However, protests like these once every few years would be helpful in gradually promoting change. The clerics are old, and even many of their own children are normal ""millenials"" who don't really care for religion, at least in private. They will eventually die out. Then there is internet and social media. So it is a matter of time, 10-20 years. The problem then becomes removing the corrupt entities within and outside the IRGC.

This has been an issue for a long time, just they're stepping up the enforcement of it. Friends from UAE have been unable to use their microphones on discord for a while, though they have been able to listen to others talk. Using VPNs to use voice chat can get you into trouble too so they just resorted to disabling their microphones.

A friend of mine from Jordan has also reported issues using his microphone and hasn't been able to identify any local issues so I don't know if governments/ISPs in other Arab countries are following UAE's steps.

It's a bit crazy in modern day though. I forgot what the reasoning was but it was something like fighting terrorism. I think messenger software like WhatsApp etc is monitored over there too. 
It's not about free speech, it's about money. The government runs a telecom monopoly owning both services you can buy. VOIP and cheap international calls through Skype hinders their ability to charge (quite literally) some of the most expensive usage rates in the world.

[deleted]
From someone who was in the top tier from my country, a deeply unequal one, and moved to another with a pretty flat pay scale (compared)...

Executives make more money, and there's a whole argument about responsibility, skill, replaceability etc that doesnt really matter.

The thing is, for reals, when the gaps get too big, your society pays for it with violence, transportation problems, uneducated people, poor productivity, corruption etc. 

The executives, regardless of if they earned or not the position, are trapped in their condos afraid of being kidnapped while dreaming about moving to the more equal country. They are angry for not enjoying their life, and they think of the ""unfair amounts of income taxes they pay"" (plus double paying for private services that they should expect from the government) that are going nowhere, and the solution is ""not paying more. Never"".

The poor are struggling with rising inflation and big consumption taxes, living far away from work, having a shit education and healthcare provided by the government. They hate the executives because they ""don't really work and are exploring us"" and dream to be them, but only on TV. They don't pay income taxes because most of them are hired illegally and have shit productivity because either they do the minimum, or/because they don't know how to do better because training is inexistent. 

The middle class think it's poor (it isn't) and dreams of being executives too, but don't hate them, just think they are one step away of being them, so they defend everything they do. They pay income and consumption taxes, live far away, pay for private services, live in fear of violence like the executives and although they think they are poor, they hate the poor because ""they are lazy parasites"",  strangely at the same time they say a lot ""honey you should try a job in the government, great pay, little work, you'll be settled for life"". They consume a lot and don't have the money to pay for stuff like executives, so they drown in bills and stupid gadgets.

The government, who are the same guys since forever, sees the hate flow, uses it as propaganda and while the ideological war is going, the corruption grows, the government machinery grows. They are untouched and protect among themselves, so why work? And those who try something are received with stones because any change will mess this status quo of unhappiness and people are afraid of things getting worse, so no reform in the laws, in the taxes, in the pensions, nothing can change... nothing will change. 

Everybody hates the government but don't know what to do about it and forget pretty quickly about who stole what in which corruption scandal, ""whatever, as long as the guy hates the same social class we do"".


And the country will keep on getting more unequal.
The poor will be more miserable, the middle class will disappear and the rich will collapse on paranoia.

TLDR: I'm sad about my home country and needed to vent.

Edit: words and more sadness

Interesting how Iran is front page news while this, Honduras and the KRG protest barely make a peep. 
I worry that a massacre is about to take place.

There has been protests planned all across the country today (December 31st) calling for elections. Elections were supposed to happen a year ago, and President Joseph Kabila's second term was supposed to end, but the government canceled the elections (claiming they weren't ready basically) and now Joseph Kabila has just continued on as President.

Kabila is basically a kleptocrat who steals all the country's money to pay off his cronies. He's only barely holding onto power and throwing everything he can at making sure that he remains in office.

Last year, at least 40 people were killed by the country's military when protests broke out. These protests are possibly going to be much larger.

In response to the protests, the government of the DRC completely shut down the internet and the SMS system across the country last night (apparently they have the ability to do this). Tanks and soldiers have been reported to be taking up positions in strategic locations where the protesters will likely be congregating.

Elections were supposed to happen a year ago, and President Joseph Kabila's second term was supposed to end, but the government canceled the elections (claiming they weren't ready basically) and now Joseph Kabila has just continued on as President. 

Kabila is basically a kleptocrat who steals all the country's money to pay off his cronies. He's only barely holding onto power and throwing everything he can at making sure that he remains in office.

Last year, at least 40 people were killed by the country's military when protests broke out. These protests are possibly going to be much larger.

In response to the protests, the government of the DRC completely shut down the internet and the SMS system across the country last night (apparently they have the ability to do this). Tanks and soldiers have been reported to be taking up positions in strategic locations where the protesters will likely be congregating.

> GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo - Democratic Republic of Congo&#039;s government on Saturday ordered telecommunications providers to cut internet and SMS services across the country ahead of planned anti-government demonstrations.

> Security forces killed dozens of protesters during anti-Kabila demonstrations last year, and deteriorating security has led to fears of renewed civil strife in Congo, where millions of people died in civil wars around the turn of the century.

> Congo&#039;s government also cut internet and SMS service during anti-government demonstrations in January 2015 and more recently ordered limits to certain social media access, one of more than a dozen African governments to have done so in the past two years.

0,1.0,1.0,1.0,Colombia ships 55 tons of ham to Venezuela amid shortage of holiday staple,https://globalnews.ca/news/3939425/venezuela-ham-shortage-colombia/,1514689742,3688,235.4042553191493,"That's sweet. Unfortunately it's less than 2 grams of ham per Venezuelan person. They are in really really big trouble and need much bigger help -- the government really destroyed the economy.
The same country the Venezuelan government has been using as a scapegoat for its incompetence for years now... 
Venezuela is in a death spiral. The economy is based on oil, and they were wrecked by the price collapse. The thing is that with the nationalisation of the oil industry funds were diverted from investment into social programs. When oil collapsed, they doubled down. This meant they couldn't pay foreign service companies. Not a big deal if  you have traditional oil fields. However, Venezuela is much like the Canadian tar sands. Lots of oil, but it needs a ton of expertise and infrastructure to exploit. 

Venezuela has burned its bridges so much that no foreign expertise is willing to work for them. Halliburton, Jacobs Engineering, and a number of other companies might be the poster child of evil corp. But they also are able to provide incredibly experienced teams.

Venezuela desperately needs that foreign experience. And it isn't going to happen. The oil coming out of the country is increasingly poor, to the point that they are issuing discounts or having deliveries refused. Further, the only tankers that are able to move the oil are from Venezuela because everyone else is concerned about being paid. The thing is that these ships are in such poor condition that the crews have to spend days cleaning the ship before they leave port or risk being refused entry in the states.

What is worse is that because of the lack of international investment, and the general lack of local investment, the industry in the country is coming close to collapse. Its a death spiral, changing governments isn't enough anymore, if it ever was an option.

Its a country that should be wealthy, but has managed to paint itself into a corner. The fix is either 150 a barrel oil, or a brutal economic landing.
'International sabotage perpetrated by Portugal'. Really. There's a global ham-conspiracy to sabotage Venezuela's favorite Christmas food.

REALLY. That's scraping the proverbial bottom of the barrel in pathetic excuses. o_O
Venezuelans are fleeing Venezuela in truly massive numbers. Brazil is receiving hundreds of immigrants everyday, and easily over 40 thousand have already entered Brazil. And that's not mentioning that the Brazilian-Venezuelan border is located in the Amazon Rainforest, far from major roads and towns. The number in Colombia is much much higher. Not to mention many thousands are also leaving for Guyana, Trinidad, the US, the Caribbean and other South American countries like Peru, Chile and Argentina. If the situation keeps getting worse (and it will) millions will flee
From now on when I think of Colombian exports I will think of ham.
No sympathy whatsoever. They were given a gift that every other country in the world has been able to turn into a solid income stream (oil) and catastrophically failed to manage it in any correct way, why constantly making aggressive and illegal attempts to steal their neighbour's (Guyana's) land.

[Mmmm, 55 slices of American cheese..](https://imgur.com/RYc0wo2)
Yup. Portugal did it. Had nothing to do with the rampant graft and corruption and refusing to save money and diversify. Nope, Portugal did it. I feel a massive revolt and a whole lot of assassinations coming.

> DUBAI - Street protests hit Iran for a third day running on Saturday, spreading to the capital Tehran with crowds confronting police and attacking some state buildings, and a social media report said two demonstrators had been shot dead in a provincial town.

> Videos posted on social media from the western town of Dorud showed two young men lying motionless on the ground, covered with blood, and a voiceover said they had been shot dead by riot police firing on protesters.

> Though purely political protests are seldom seen in Iran, demonstrations are often held by workers over lay-offs or non-payment of salaries and by people who hold deposits in non-regulated, bankrupt financial institutions.

America can't even take care of Puerto Rico so foreign countries can start a line. 
This may sound heartless and at an individual level it definitely is but why do all Western countries have to save other countries from starvation?

If your neighbour, like your actual neighbour living right next door in your street, was starving then how is that your fault? It's not, sadly it's their fault. Even more sad is when neighbouring cultures create scenarios that result in mass events like this but is aid the answer? Won't we have to feed them indefinitely like the African aid scenario that has been on going for 50+ years with no end in sight?

Makes sense. 

Edit: I forgot people in the U.S don't remember those ""war drills"" include flying bombers near north korean airspace. The same bombers that turned north Korea to rubble during the war, including their dams(a war crime people at Nuremberg were hanged for doing) and rice crops. Except now those bombers can/do carry a bunch of nuclear weapons. 

If any country was pulling that stunt on the Mexican U.S border that country would be nuked.

Does it strike anyone else as odd that a story about Nepal banning solo mountain treks has nearly 50x as many upvotes as a breaking story about civil unrest in one of the middle east powerhouses? 
This is an unfortunate case of deja vu for Iran. After the protests of the rigged election in 2009, Khamenei warned the people that if they continued to demonstrate on the streets, ""their fate would be in their own hands"". And that turning point was when the mass arresting started and they started to kill some protestors, with the death count shooting up to around 80. Only time will tell what happens this time around.

Edit: [Iranian forces open fire on protesters as protests continue for third day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7n4e20/iranian_forces_open_fire_on_protesters_as/) And this is one of those times where I'm ashamed to be right. The fucking savages did it again.

so happy my health care is going to the lowest bidder yey !!! /s
UK expat living in America. Trust me, you don't want our healthcare system. Privatising healthcare results in one more person in the chain wanting a cut. To satisfy executives and shareholders, they will put downward pressure on everything that costs the company money (staff wages, quality and quantity of care, etc.). Virgin will charge more, provide less, and will shirk responsibility when it needs to be held accountable.

Edit: for clarity, I'm talking about the US Healthcare system.
[deleted]
And the rich get richer
Do conservatives exist solely to fuck up everything they touch? 
Swede here. I'd like to tell you how I think healthcare privatization turned out for us. It might not be privatization itself but perhaps how it was carried out, regardless here is the result.


One of the leading arguments for privatization has been that private clinics have more incentive to be cost effective. (Even if that's true, there's nothing that says there is no incentive to apply cost effective practices to public healthcare, since there's only so much tax money.)


Since private healthcare is subsidized, healthcare is still REALLY affordable:
Someone in my immediate family suffered from spinal cancer and paid about €50 for the initial appointment. After that, all treatment (all visits, MRI, rad.) was covered by tax money. I'm not sure about prescription drugs but there's a ceiling to how much you pay out of your own pocket per year (€200?), until it's covered by tax money.
Private healthcare and private pharmacies. Sounds pretty good, right? What's the problem?


Since the whole idea with a business (private clinic) is **to make money** (rather than just seeing to the health of the nation), they have to make a profit somehow. Since you can't really increase the number of people being sick or increase the subsidy, **you have to reduce cost.** (Or in the case of a number of private dentists, making up health issues that aren't there. https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10535174.ab )


**So how do you cut costs?**
**Eliminate waste.** Sure, but since people in public healthcare aren't stupid (at least medical personell for private clinics have to come from somewhere, either straight out of med. school or *from public clinics*) and still have a limited budget, they have to be cost-effective too.
**Cut down on personell.**
Less staff, less expenses - even if that means people will have to wait for longer for an appointment. (Unless you or your employer have enough money for a private healthcare insurance (like skandia lifeline access, to name one) which gets you instant appointment.)
**Cut down on quality.**
Like weighing the elderly's diapers to see if they are full enough to warrant a new one, for example.
( https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/stockholm/20111111122727_carema_vager_de_aldres_kissblojor )


**But aren't there any guidelines that define what good healthcare is?**
In 2006, Fredrik Reinfeldt ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrik_Reinfeldt ) became prime minister and spearheaded the healthcare privatization.
In 2006, his wife, Filippa Reinfeldt ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippa_Reinfeldt ) became the Health Service Commissioner for Stockholm County.


Other family members have worked in Stockholm County Health Service and witnessed her policy changes up close. In short, the key performance indicator became number of treatments - not the number of cured patients. (I'm specifically talking about psychiatry here, hoping I won't out anyone.) I think it was said that the idea was to apply production industry methodology to healthcare, I could be wrong though.


After Filippa Reinfeldt didn't become re-elected as Health Service Commissioner for Stockholm County, she became a partner of private-owned health care company (Aleris), responsible for business development and public affairs.

(In Sweden, it's not unusual nor exclusive to right-wing politicians to get a nice job ""at the other end of regulation"" after leaving politics. Here are some left-wing politicians that pretty much did the same thing (one even was privately engaged while still remaining politically active for the social democrats (Pär Nuder)):
Göran Persson (former prime minister, even)
Thomas Bodström
Pär Nuder
Laila Freivalds
Erik Åsbrink
Thomas Östros
Jens Henriksson
Anders Sundström
Klas Eklund
Björn Rosengren
Ulrica Messing)


TL;DR:
Privatization (done wrong?) is a great way to siphon tax money into private pockets, at the expense of the nation's healthcare quantity/quality.

Nice euphemism for bribery.
To be fair, from their perspective, Israel needs visible support. 

It’s all symbolic anyway, if th UN was anything but symbolic, more weight (even slightly) would be given to countries that contributed more or had higher population. Until then, they really won’t be able to decide much without the support of thier most powerful member states.
The UN: where a country of 13,000 has the same voting power as Germany and can dictate the domestic affairs of another country. My god its like the electoral college and Russia all wrapped into one, why isn't Reddit screaming themselves hoarse over it?

Title is a little misleading. The UVF (loyalist terrorist group, the IRA's opposite number in a rough sense) sent a letter to the Irish Government saying that MI5 had asked them to assassinate Haughey, who at the time was a former Taoiseach (Irish PM), although they told him two years later in 1987, when he was Taoiseach again.

The UVF may have been lying (or even mislead, although that seems unlikely), although there is a history of British state collusion with loyalist terrorist groups, so it's not impossible either. It's hard to see what would have been gained by Haughey's assassination. This may just have been an attempt to damage Anglo-Irish relations. You did have peace talks going on around that time, and Haughey come very much out of the Nationalist/Republican wing of Fianna Fáil, the side that today stills calls Sinn Féin ""Provisional Sinn Féin"".
British cunts doing what British cunts do... secretly plotting the demise of every nation they came in contact with. Biggest back stabbers of the world, now feeling superior and civilized want to lecture the world about good and evil.

This is absolutely beautiful.  Iran needs change and the more the better.
The only way any type of revolution will happen is if at least a quarter of the military and police switch sides. If this did not happen during the 2009 protests, I don't see it happening now. While much of the military and police seemed to be secretly sympathetic towards the cause of the protesters in 2009 (the regime had to rely on using the basij and bus in poor uneducated villagers from villages around the country, or if it is to be believed, Lebanese Shia militia forces, to use violence on the protesters), they simply did not see the protests as big enough to risk switching sides over. The only way it will happen is if the economy starts to get worse to the point that millions of people cannot afford staple food items, and/or if the merchants in the bazaar get hit hard and decide to join the protests by shutting down the bazaar. Both cases are highly unlikely at this moment or anytime soon. However, these protests may not be totally pointless, they might scare the regime into giving at least some concessions, in the form of improving the economy/giving economic aid packages, and/or giving very slight increases in personal freedom. These protests will likely die down in a few days or weeks, I don't think they will reach the scale of the 2009 protests. However, one significant escalation from the 2009 protests and this one is that people are showing slogans such as ""death to Rouhani"" (a reformist/centrist within the regime) whereas in 2009, most people, in their slogans at least, supported the within the regime reformists such as Moussavi and Karroubi. But the Iranian people must be careful to not go back to a Shah era system, that is not much of an upgrade: selling your culture and people to please the Western banking cartel in order to get easy passports and a better life for the upper middle class will not be much of an upgrade. A secular democracy that encourages traditionalism and keeping culture but does not force religion would be good, and more neutral relations with USA but not bending over to the US like the Shah did. The capitalists in charge of the US don't give a damn about the Iranian people, they would bomb them into oblivion if that option was a realistic/good one from a tactical militaristic point of view, so Iranians must be careful to not go back to a Shah like era. The US just wants Iran to lose their culture and turn into capitalist consumer robots and sell their oil for cheap. Any deals must be done fairly with respect for both sides.
[deleted]
The sad reality is this.. 
They will protest until the Government sends in the military die hards who will then start sniping protestors from rooftops.  Just like in China, Just like in Venezuela. These military diehards have a lot to lose if the current regimes are overthrown. And they will kill the opposition in cold blood to keep the status quo.  
This is the start. In 20 years Iran will be a modern developed capitalist secular society that is open to the West and I will vacation there. 
This is a legitimate question coming from an American, how did these protests begin? It seems like they just came up out of the blue.

I wonder how long it will take until Iran and its allies will call these protestors Al-Qaeda members, Western-backed terrorists and shit like that.

The price of Bitcoin is fluctuating so quickly, I find it hard to accept that there will be any real life applications of the currency. It's actually scary that a subreddit that once had to sticky a national suicide hotline post after a crash, is now so bullish about Bitcoin with their ""HODL"" memes, it's literally a cult in /r/bitcoin 
The amount of salt in this thread is higher than Bitcoin price
I don't think that's the main issue with cryptocurrencies. The main issue is that anyone can make up their own. Having a handful of agencies that says what is and isn't actual money is the difference between cutely drawn paper and actual currency. 
I think the headline to the article needs to be changed. Even the body of the article contradicts the headline.

According to the article the ministry of finance said cryptocurrencies are like ponzi schemes. Similarity was the only thing stated. They also said to be careful because the government removed all protections when dealing with them, since it is hard to tax. 

Also, according to their actual statement shown here: http://www.pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1514568

The problem with cryptocurrencies is they aren’t backed by any assets/government fiat making pricing speculative. They also said this might cause an investment bubble causing investors to lose money. The investment bubble formed is the only aspect similar to ponzi schemes, according to their full statement.
People commenting here saying it's not a ponzi scheme, don't known what is a ""ponzi scheme"". it means some maybe winners, most potencial losers.

Definition

> A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit of financial trading.

Yep, that definition potentially suits Bitcoin like Cryptocurrencies.. virtual currency and no value.




All ponzi schemes are fraud. Not all crypto currencies are fraudulent.

This is probably a big part of why the US embassy move to Jerusalem was timed the way it was. Iran just got slapped down by Israel and played by Russia in Syria, while simultaneously going full on against Saudi in Yemen. They're in a weak position with Hezbollah and not capable to support Hamas now. Iran has been using the Palestinians as a proxy against the US-Israel axis for some time but their status as a regional power might be threatened now.

I'd guess the regime is going to be in trouble and Iranians are probably going to want to pull in as much Chinese investment as they can.

How is this a surprise? I remember all the posts saying ""6 months until Puerto Rico can get power back"" right after the storm
The islands power grid was in horrible condition before the storm. It’s like somebody with a beat up car getting into an accident and then saying “oh my god you wrecked my car! You’ve gotta buy me a brand new one” since day one the media has made this out to be the federal governments fault for not fixing everything that was wrong with the island BEFORE THE HURRICANE. 
With independence being a big political issue there, one has to wonder if there's some intentional feet dragging at the local government level.
>Among those still in the dark is Christian Pagan . . .

I wonder what their middle name is. 
The devil is in the details. In 90 days efforts have restored power to 1.8 million people in the face of complete and absolute  infrastructure devastation. That is a good outcome. 

This would be a valid complaint if people were saying they are done, but mainlanders continue to spend their time, and taxes, to restore utilities to an island that let them go to hell long before the storm.

Partisan hacks like this mayor disgust me. Only a truly evil person could treat her own people as if they were stupid enough to buy her bias.

Indicted=charged with a crime by state/federal prosecutor 

Charged=see above

This is a civil suit for damages brought by private attorneys, on behalf of their clients, the alleged victims. 

Doesn’t make the allegations any less horrific. But the standards for making them are different from if they were being charged with a crime. 

Also not saying I disbelieve the allegations. Fits perfectly with my understanding of the practices of the FLDS cult. I just like reporting to be accurate.

> The question of whether the Russian state supported the fuel transfer comes as Russia, a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council, one week ago joined other members on the body in a unanimous vote on new sanctions banning nearly 90 percent of petroleum exports to North Korea.

> North Korea&#039;s foreign ministry in a statement Sunday called the latest sanctions an &quot;Act of war.&quot; The North needs imported fuel to keep its suffering economy afloat and also for its nuclear and missile development program.

> At least eight North Korean vessels this year departed from Russia carrying fuel and sailed toward their homeland despite claiming different destinations, the news outlet reported in September.

Our company manufacturers a bunch of stuff and sells most of our stock through distributors. We decided to try to sell some of our products online, but when we registered the UPC, it was already tied to a product that looked like ours. We decided to order the product to find out if it was one of our distributors using Amazon. Turns out it was a knock off from China that had our branding on it. We tried to appeal to Amazon about the issue since the product damaged our brand but they told us to use a different UPC. Amazon doesn't care about your brand. They only care about Amazon.

As a former Samsung owner, I can confirm. They slow down on their own after 6 months with no updates usually
That's good marketing.
Sure, my note 4 suddenly dies with 25% battery. So much better. 
...because they never get software updates :(
IIRC, In the US a typical smartphone only lasts about 4.6 years before something happens to force a replacement.  Doesn’t matter who makes it all of this shit is all built to fail, and their is no such thing as a BIFL option when your dealing with this kind of hardware.

To the posts point- No, they (being Google developers, the hardware manufacturer, and the cellular carrier) don’t slow the batteries of Android devices, (ok well perhaps Samsung did this very thing just last year to keep those notes from exploding), but even worse they all seem totally ok with nopatching (usually within the first 2 years), which leads to developers rapidly abandoning support as they need to keep their apps current to newer standards.   Once that disconnect starts the device just sort of exist in limbo running older and less advanced apps until the user finally gets sick of the experience.

Personally, I will happily take a slower battery on a fully supported platform..  I can at least get a battery replaced and if that $29 cost keeps the device running in a fully patched and wholly functional state for more than 2 years it’s a win.
Maybe not directly, but what about those damn ""sim card removed - restart phone"" bullshit messages that I got almost non-stop when my galaxy s4 got old and then when my lg v10 hit about a year old and now that I've experienced on my v20 in the last few days now that it is a year old...
They let the carrier slow down service instead. Every phone I have had with Verizon suddenly goes to shit about two moths before my contract is over. Strange.
Lets just agree to disagree?
Samsung also don't do software updates either... I've got a perfect Galaxy Note 3 but stuck on Android 5?!  WTF?  The hardware can handle 7 or even 8.

Canada's court system is based on the British system.  Although our Charter is part of our constitution, it is not a supreme document like the US constitution is.  There are many laws in Canada that go against the charter that have been fought up and down through our court system.

Mandatory minimums are a controversial one, only because it came from the unpopular Stephen Harper.  Harper wanted mandatory minimums on marijuana.

This is the third of these that has been struck down.

The first to be struck down was a mandatory minimum sentence of two years for anyone who is caught selling marijuana or other illegal drugs to children.  The judge argued that it was too broad.

The second was for growing over 1000 marijuana plants (two years).  This was struck down after the plaintiff (a woman who was growing 1100 marijuana plants across the roofs of three apartment buildings she did not own) was found guilty.

And finally we have one for a person who produces 200 to 1000 marijuana plants for trafficking, like this man.  The mandatory minimum.... six months.
I wish the headlines were a little more detailed. For starters, not all of us know what or where BC is when we first see it. 
The real crime here was that he rendered the house uninhabitable.  If I was the landlord I’d be pretty choked at having to gut the house because some asshole decided to run a grow-op in it.
Canada is moving in the right direction. All I'm gonna going to say.

Good for you Cuba, keep up the good work!
That's pretty impressive for such a poor and authoritarian island country. At least the people have decent healthcare. Hopefully things continue to improve. The Castros despite being dictators didn't want to be idolized (no statues, portraits, etc), so maybe then can make a slow transition to democracy eventually. 
It's at its lowest in MOST countries
Cuba junior gooding.
This is the only economic indicator that Cuba will provide. So we know Cuba is capable of providing economic indicators, but for some reason they refuse to do so for the rest of the economy. Cuba has taught Venezuela well.

Freedom to iranians. Good luck with your protest
If any country has a promising future in the Middle East, it's Iran. They have an incredibly youthful population, who are increasingly secular and pro-Western. Unlike our other allies in the ME whereby they have ""secular"" leaders and an extremely conservative population, Iran is the complete opposite.

We should do everything we can to spread the embers of democracy (outside of intervention). The future ally of the United States in the region is not Saudi Arabia, but rather Iran.

Why does the NBA have a depiction of Palestine or any nation for that matter? 
1. The idea that The State of Israel has the leverage to force the NBA to do anything is kind of absurd so imho the article title is inflammatory.

2. I'm not sure why Israel object to the use of the term anyway.  My understanding is that Israel never attempted to annex those territories because if they did they would have to grant citizenship to everyone who lives there which is not something they want to do for whatever reason.  So the territories remain, by all accounts, occupied.

3. Why does the NBA website even mention this in the first place?
In the article, these Israeli officials keep referring to ""USA's stance"" that East Jerusalem is not occupied territory. We've never given our support to Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. Did I miss something in recent news or are they lying?
They are not occupying anyone tbey are just keeping the Palestinians company.... Inna non optional way.

""Boy, 100+ years ago you would've been considered a grown man. 14 years old and you would've had a wife and children, working on the farm etc. You need to get your head out of your ass and start acting like a man.""


All I could think was; ""You say this, yet I still have a bedtime.""
So the age of adulthood now is 2040?
The skeptical side of me thinks they're doing this to pad their ""working adults"" numbers that are going to shit.

> The Imperial House Law stipulates that the age of adulthood for the emperor and crown prince is 18.

> Even after the lower age is put into the Commercial Code the government plans to maintain the legal age for drinking, smoking and gambling unchanged at 20 due to concern about health and addiction risks.

> When the age of adulthood becomes 18, the government will ease the age requirement for certified accountants and medical practitioners without changing the clauses of relevant laws saying licenses for those professions should not be given to minors.

In my country the age of adulthood is 11, 13, 16 and 18.
We need a single set of laws imposed by the United Nations or armies instructed to confine backwards people to their shitty little islands.
Well in Japan, the age of consent is 13 so this is not surprising.

Nature's ""internet"" keeps us all alive, including other species like bees and insects. Using fungicide, or any other kind of 'cide, is a devastatingly stupid thing to do for any reason, even more so when it's connected to food supply for all species, including ours, and the bees.
Stop fucking spraying toxins on things. Surprise surprise, it fucks up the environment.

I go pick wild blackberries every year. They're not sprayed with pesticides or fungicides or anything, and there's always more than you could possibly eat. Very few go bad. The same with the apples my parents grow. We don't need these things. We need bees.
Why would this surprise scientists when scientific testing was obviously not required before these chemicals were turned loose? This is what happens when corporations, profit, and greed are allowed to run rampant.

Lets all agree that the death penalty is wrong and by extension a cop killing someone without their day in court is even worse.

If someone dies involving the police, there should be an automatic court case involving all those involved and someone goes to prison for manslaughter at a minimum. The police then have admitted they pulled the trigger killing that man. So we guilt is already admitted. 

If the police don't want to go to prison, they better figure out who should be; in this case the swatting person?

This is one of those issues that always causes a lot of strong feelings for and against to emerge. I think it's important to mention that Ireland, despite having made a lot of progressive changes towards divorce, gay marriage, transgender rights, etc. is still rooted deeply in a Catholic culture

This culture isn't a simple young, left-wing, city, people vs. old, conservative, rural, people. I'm from Dublin myself and despite what you might immediately think the mood is mostly mixed towards this whole thing.

I think most Irish people would be in favour of abortion in cases of rape, incest, or under a certain age, but full access would be outside of possibility from what I've seen/heard. I've known women who have chosen to have an abortion in England, and those who decided to keep the child, both made their choices and most people would respect that, but you have to consider that there remains a stigma of sorts towards abortion in Ireland.

The question becomes what to replace the 8th amendment with, and the wording is going to be key to the end result of the vote for most Irish people.

I guess unless you're Australian you won't get the absurdity of this story. The Prime Minister, a multi millionaire who lives on the water, was issued the maritime equivalent to a J walking fine.

0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,Columbia University Professor : Don't make the mistake of thinking Trump doesn't know about climate change. He knows. People need to understand what's going on. The american Republican Party is funded by Charles Koch and David Koch. Two of the wealthiest oil fortunes in the United States.,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-06-02/sachs-koch-brothers-behind-trump-s-climate-exit-video,1514535765,336,41.52808988764043,"Who are the Kochs? (Edit: Source for this is the phenomenal *Dark Money* by Jane Mayer)

>On its own in 2012, the Kochs' network of a few hundred individuals spent at least $407 million, almost all of it anonymously. This was more than John McCain spent on his entire 2008 presidential bid. And it was more than the combined contributions to the two presidential campaigns made by 5,667,658 Americans, whose donations were legally capped at $5,000. *Politico's* Kenneth Vogel crunched the numbers and discovered that in the presidential race the top .04 percent of donors contributed about the same amount as the bottom 68%.


And, for 2018, with [Pence's assistance](http://time.com/4962821/mike-pence-koch-brothers/):

>The Koch-backed groups expect to spend as much as $400 million during the 2018 election cycle, either directly on these races or on the periphery to push policies that dovetail with the candidates.

We really need to work on cutting down the [proliferation of dark money funding our elections](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/A_Maze_of_Money.png/1307px-A_Maze_of_Money.png); class warfare is the Republican strategy. We already have explosive social stratification and limited social mobility, but rather than treating that, we're racing head-on toward the policies that will exacerbate the problem. Dirt like Robert Mercer, the Koch brothers, and their networks pump millions of dollars into election cycles in order to buy favorable coverage. They're worked endlessly to weaken out protections in favor of their own nutty anarcho-capitalist ideas.

This hurts candidates: for them, [shadowy groups](https://dividednolonger.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/kochtopus.png) funding attacks ads is a bit like being in a boxing ring with your opponent while people from the audience pelt you with items to throw you off your game. For voters, it's a bit like wandering through a forest and running into a bunch of different people [wearing masks](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0c/ae/45/0cae45413635f05a5ad442d32f54e979.jpg), all trying to talk you into do the same thing until you find out that underneath the masks, it's all the same guy, changing his appearance cause he has the funds and means to fool you. And how do these people feel about workers? Let's take a look at [Robert Mercer](http://www.npr.org/2017/03/22/521083950/inside-the-wealthy-family-that-has-been-funding-steve-bannon-s-plan-for-years) of Cambridge Analytica, who is one of the Kochs major donors and was one of the instrumental people who funded Trump's campaign, as well as bringing Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon onto his team:

>[David Magerman, a partner at Renaissance Technologies] said that Mercer wanted to shrink the government to the size of a pinhead and that he doesn't think that - he basically has a philosophy, according to Magerman, that values people on the basis of what they earn. [He doesn't think human beings have intrinsic value.](https://mindinflux.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/nazi6.jpg) He thinks that if you are a schoolteacher and you earn 2 million times less than Mercer earns, then you're 2 million times less valuable than Mercer is. And he believes that if you are on welfare, you have negative value. And what Magerman said was, and he's not talking about economically. He means as a human being.

For them, it's not a matter of finding out what the American people want; it's how much money they need to use to run focus groups to trick the Americans into voting for what the wealthy want. Look at the ""inheritance tax"" being called the [""death tax.""](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-many-people-pay-estate-tax). Or any of the other shady work by [Frank Luntz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Luntz).

Gotta [follow the money](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/31/koch-brothers-donor-network-to-focus-on-senate-not-presidential-race.html).

For the last 40 years, they've been using their [family foundations to funnel money] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_family_foundations) into building an ideological pipeline to normalize conservative ideas and shift the goalposts of the discussion, groups like the [Cato Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute), [the Reason Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_Foundation), [Mercatus Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercatus_Center), the [Heritage Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation), all of these libertarian thinktanks and others that are shadily funded and happen to crank out position papers against worker protections, regulations, minimum wage, etc., claiming it is in the interest of workers even though it these same things have consistently screwed them over. Take a look at how they duck regulations to treat their employees, seemingly completely at odds with their libertarian philosophy of employers looking out for their workers:  [Bull Carlson](http://realkochfacts.com/snowzilla-reading-the-devastating-story-of-how-the-kochs-business-practices-hurt-real-people/) (fired with minimal severance after his work with Koch left him with cancer), [Sally Barnes-Soliz](http://kochcash.org/victims-voices-sally-barnes-soliz/) (fired for pointing out that the Kochs reported less than 1% of their actual benzene emissions), [Carnell Green](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-whistle-blower-accuses-the-kochs-of-poisoning-an-arkansas-town) (fired and intimidated by a Koch security officer pretending to be FBI for reporting improper disposal of the toxic substance mercury), and [Danielle Smalley and Jason Stone](http://kochcash.org/victims-voices-danielle-smalley-jason-stone/) (non-Koch employees; shortly after graduation, car stops on a road; when the key is turned in the ignition, it leads to an explosion. Why? Because the Kochs were using an underground pipeline that ""looked like Swiss cheese"" to transport an explosive gas) are all eye-opening reads.

By viewing the centralist establishment as socialism, the Kochs and other libertarians redefined their extreme-right-wing, borderline anarchist views into a marketable product by spending hundreds of millions of dollars raised from them and other wealthy people to test different groups in order to weaponize information (Look at Luntz's work to discredit environmental science, though he later acknowledged global warming as serious).

When they, and other billionaires, were young, there was a loophole to avoid the inheritance tax: if the money was put into a trust and given to charitable groups for X (usually 20) years, then the money could be inherited tax-free. They weaponized this: instead of giving to legitimate, establishment charities (remember, they're peddling socialism, per the Kochs!), they found out how to create and fund partisan organizations and put their money into politics while still taking advantage of the tax loophole. This often took advantage of political giving not being the ""primary"" objective of the organization.

You and I are capped at $5,000 dollar donations for candidates, non-deductible; these guys, on the other hand, through their shady funding methods, can write these expenses off as charitable donations. After *Citizens United*, they even were able to write off part of their 2012 campaign against Obama as a business expense, therefore deductible on their year-end taxes. Which is ironic, cause while Romney's out there bitching about people who don't pay taxes, [Diane Hendricks, estimated at a $3.2 billion fortune, didn't pay a penny in state income for years](http://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/wisconsins-richest-woman-paid-no-income-taxes-for-years). 

I mean the guy is inclined towards stupid conspiracies and he watches a lot of FOX, so I don't think we need to assume this is intentional misinformation on his part. He's just easily manipulated. People make the mistake of thinking that because he's in a position of power he must be better informed than the average 70 year old FOX News addict. Not that Trump isn't maliciously deceptive a lot of the time, but in this case I think Hanlon's Razor applies.
He knows but he doesn't care. 

He's what, in his seventies? I mean realistically its not going to affect him in the slightest, I doubt he gives the slightest fuck about leaving that kind of legacy to the next generation as long as he doesn't have to make any sacrifices in the mean time.
I know climate change effects us all, and I fully fear for the consequences, but how is this post allowed on worldnews / why does this not break rule 1?
https://m.imgur.com/W5IcH6I

It's called rationalization, and it's what makes humans human, more than any other characteristic. Simply put, if we perceive that a thing would be counter to our material interests, then we will go to great effort not to understand it.
I think he is right.We need to Understand
He shitposted to win Presidency becase HRC was total mockery of a candidate and DNC was comically mismanaged.

He thought he can shitpost and win against climate change by making people go green whenever he shitposts.  Good luck with that.  Because countering his opposition now require logic, rationality, scientific process and lot of ethics.

This is the Classic Canadian corruption scheme.


By making sure only the ""right"" company and people can get into the business. While the rest can't even get a permit.
 Hypocrisy at work.
I have to say this every time. Julian Fantino is a truly awful human
see the average joe is not qualified. but they are. what are their qualifications you ask? bullying, corruption, lack of morality....
So dirty cops & politicians can now do what they have been doing for years but now it will be legal.
Means the business is ON for them.
I'm personally NEVER going to buy weed from ex-politicians and ex-police.
These guys are corrupt to the bone. Playing the system like old money. 
They're learning about the system and setting up their pieces for moment that it's legalized. 
Meanwhile every person who wants to sell cannabis products and paraphernalia is getting raided by swat.
Wouldn't it be illegal to be a participant in setting up an industry and benefitting from knowing the framework ahead of the public release?

Have seen several articles calling out former law enforcement for getting involved with legal pot. I really don't see how this is an issue that people are upset about. They did their job when it was a controlled substance and now should have every right to be involved with the legitimate business side of it.

SABRATHA, Libya — For nearly two years, this ancient, beachfront city, famed for its Roman ruins, was one of North Africa’s largest smuggling hubs, a gateway for tens of thousands of migrants seeking better futures in Europe. Now, there are none on the beaches where hundreds of rickety boats once ferried them to Italy illegally, none in the migrant detention center where they ended up when an attempt failed.

At the five-star West Tallil Holiday resort, the white, two-story villas once housed as many as 3,000 migrants at a time waiting to set sail. Their traffickers, who had seized the hotel, had erected sand dunes along the beach to hide them from Libyan coast guard patrols and curious swimmers.

The resort is now empty, as are the smugglers’ other safe houses.

Ferocious street battles among rival armed groups erupted this fall, ultimately driving out the young warlord Ahmed Dabbashi, whose militia ran the trade in migrants. The victors then expelled the migrants.

A rare visit by a reporter to Sabratha this month revealed how the massive trafficking of Africans, which has roiled European countries and raised concerns about widespread abuses of the migrants, is tied up with Libya’s internal power struggles. The ebb and flow of migration reflect the shifting fortunes of the city’s civil war, emblematic of the strife afflicting Libya since the Arab Spring.

Dabbashi, a black-haired and bearded fighter from a prominent tribe, widely known by his nickname Amu, had been above the law. As a teen, he had stolen cars and robbed shops, then graduated into trafficking arms and fuel. By the summer of 2015, he had entered the burgeoning migrant trade, according to local officials, tribal leaders and United Nations investigators. His control over that trade deepened as Libya’s weak, U.N.-installed government in the capital, Tripoli, looked the other way.

“He was a vicious fighter,” Col. Najmi Farah, a police investigator, said of Dabbashi. “He always carried two revolvers.”

Locals say he once killed two men and dumped their bodies on the street to stir fear in people. From then on, residents were too scared to look him in the eye.

The fierce urban clashes broke out after one of Dabbashi’s cousins was killed in September in a skirmish with a competing armed group. Soon, other militias and tribes joined the fray, making common cause against Dabbashi’s forces, called the Anas al-Dabbashi Brigade.

Some migrants were killed in the crossfire, their bodies strewn in the streets. Thousands more fled to neighboring areas. When the migrants reemerged, an unlikely coalition of Libyan National Army soldiers and ultraconservative Muslim fighters were in control of Sabratha. Known as the Anti-ISIS Fighting Room, they swiftly dispatched most of the migrants to detention centers in other cities.

“It’s finished for now,” said Muhammed Amma, 32, a migrant from Chad who fled the fighting and was now cleaning streets for the municipality. “The boats to Europe have stopped.”

**‘Easy money’**

Amid the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, Dabbashi helped lead a rebel brigade during the NATO-supported revolt that toppled Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi. When Dabbashi’s cousin, Anas, was killed in one clash, the brigade was renamed in his honor.

In the ensuing chaos, criminal and smuggling networks expanded. Human smuggling became the most lucrative.

“It’s easy money,” said Hussein Dhwadi, Sabratha’s mayor. “It’s better than trafficking in drugs.”

In August 2015, more than 200 migrants drowned off the coast of Zuwarah, 15 miles west of Sabratha. That disaster triggered an angry backlash by locals in Zuwarah, who pushed the smugglers out. Thousands of migrants headed toward Sabratha, generating even more wealth for Dabbashi.

Though Dabbashi was known to smoke and drink whiskey and seldom prayed at the mosque, members of his clan aided or sympathized with the Islamic State, which had by then turned Sabratha into a clandestine haven, according to interviews with local officials, police and tribal leaders. In a report this year, U.N. investigators said the Dabbashi militia had “links with local elements” of the Islamic State.

Neither Dabbashi, who is in hiding, nor a senior member of his militia could be reached either by phone or through messages left on his Facebook page.

After U.S. airstrikes pummeled an Islamic State compound in Sabratha in February 2016, killing scores of militants, tribal and ­local armed groups rose up to push out the remaining extremists. Dabbashi himself turned forcefully against the Islamic State, a strategic decision to preserve his trafficking. He also nominally aligned himself with the Western-backed government in Tripoli, one of three regimes competing for authority in the country.

“The Dabbashi militia was in control of everything,” said Khalid Muhammed Hassan, an influential leader of a rival tribe. “They had money and power.”

Dabbashi’s fighters manned round-the-clock checkpoints at the entrance and the exits to Sabratha and sometimes demanded bribes. They parked their tanks and trucks at a former Islamic State camp. They also trained there, using an obstacle course with tunnels to crawl through, spiked fences to jump over and ropes for climbing.

Anyone deemed a threat to their trade in humans was a target. In April, gunmen followed Jamal Ali to his office. An aid worker, he had worked with the United Nations to expose beatings and sexual assaults against migrants.

“They fired bullets at me,” ­recalled Ali. “But I got out of my car and ran.”
**
Battle for the city**

Resentment against Dabbashi’s militia rose.

“We were against them,” Hassan said. “War was inevitable.”

On Mayor Dhwadi’s desk at the Sabratha Municipal Council, his wooden nameplate is marred by a pair of bullet holes. In the summer, Dabbashi’s gunmen entered the building searching for the mayor, who was out of town.

“It was an aggression not against me but against the whole municipality,” Dhwadi said.

Tensions between the militia and the wider community, including local authorities and influential tribal leaders, finally boiled over. When the killing of Dabbashi’s cousin touched off a full-blown war, rival tribes and even ordinary citizens picked up arms to fight alongside the Anti-ISIS Fighting Room.

Fierce battles between militiamen armed with Russian-made Kalashnikov rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy artillery raged through Sabratha’s neighborhoods. Shells pounded the walls of Sabratha’s ancient outdoor theater, built by the Romans more than 1,500 years ago. Artillery and rifle fire tore into schools, municipal buildings, hospitals and storefronts.

On Oct. 6, after 19 days of fighting, Dabbashi was ousted from the city.

[Inside Libya’s thriving migrant trade]

When the Room captured a tan-and-black military building that had been Dabbashi’s operations center, they made a disturbing discovery. There were 15 African migrants locked inside what had become a makeshift jail.

“Some were sick,” recalled Sgt. Shaqir Oshash, who now guards the site. “Others couldn’t move. They hadn’t eaten in a long time.”

You'd think she'd have some kind of inherent aversion to Pandas, them being sedentary creatures barely competent to reproduce, basically kept alive by humans at this point because they look cute.  

Then again, they do frequently let the weaker of their twin offspring die, so maybe she shouldn't have been so close-minded.

Well, they're already imitating scotch whiskey now, so you might as well bring back the science technique.

The fleet of cars, etc are a bit off base, but I can see why a government would offer it to what is (essentially) a semi-popular dictator in order to get him to agree to step down, peacefully, in order to maintain order within the country. 

It wouldn't be that hard for a person like this to cause a lot of trouble for the current government, and this is basically a ""shut up and keep the peace"" settlement.

Small price to pay to remove a dictator, and small price to pay for the rest of the lifetime of a 90-year old man.

How do you build a sewage plant for $72,000?

At least America won't become like this, we sent all our manufacturing away so at least we get moderately clean air despite the poverty.
the pollution there must be a big motivator
China leads the way.
How are the other cities in China doing? 

And importantly,how is the electricity generated?

Lol, the purpose of a backed currency is that you can actually exchange the currency for whatever it's backed on. And for that purpose the ressource needs to be accessible. It also needs to be immediately and universally valuable like gold or silver which their crude isn't.
This is why you had vaults for gold and shit. If VZA could even extract that oil, let alone refine and sell it, they wouldn't be in the situation they are in now.

You really can't make this stuff up. Venezuela, a state whose president oversaw one of the worst currency devaluations(let alone worst economic downturns) in recent history is attempting to restimulate value to his currency with oil(whose value is a fraction of what it used to be) that arguably does not belong to him given the state of their debt.

Yeah, because just the threat of deportations reduced illegal immigration by [24%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/arrests-along-mexico-border-drop-sharply-under-trump-new-statistics-show/2017/12/05/743c6b54-d9c7-11e7-b859-fb0995360725_story.html?utm_term=.ba1df9da6eae) in fiscal year 2017.
The wall was designed to keep them out... but now it's keeping them IN!  DUN DUN DUNNNNN!
This is pretty narrow... Mexicans only? How about everyone who comes from farther south through Mexico (which I understand to be the actual issue)?

Interesting that the rate changes drastically after 2014. I cannot find anything pointing to a reason for this.

I mean it would follow with the end of DACA, increase arrests and the overall tone of Trump's presidency that mexicans would be less likely immigrate illegally. 

>But administrative arrests of all immigrants were up 30 per cent in fiscal year 2017. 

>'For Mexicans who enter illegally, effective tools like expedited removal have led to increased deterrence, which has impacted entry levels,' Tyler Q Houlton, acting press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said in an email to Bloomberg.


This headline is the a perfect mind fuck.... for the people that care about facts and not bullshit I guess. 
> Trump vowed last year that he was going to deport two to three million illegal immigrants with criminal records 

What’s he waiting for? Didn’t he say something about how easy a job it would being president?You don’t suppose this was just a meaningless  promise made by a politician?

I just think its ironic they just refuses to arrest the biggest fentanyl smuggler in china. But blame the us? Wat 
Wait so China is now blaming a national opium epidemic on the addicts and not the foreign smugglers?
The USA does need to do more. But the government is to busy taking handouts from Big Pharma to give a fuck. Marijuana legalization would be a step in the right direction. Because in the states that have legalized pot, the number of opioid related deaths has gone down. Along with the number of addicts. At the end of the day it's about the money, until we reign in Big Pharma nothing is going to change.
The irony here is just too much to handle.

The United States and Turkey lifted all visa restrictions on Thursday after Washington said Ankara had kept to assurances no further U.S. mission staff would be targeted for performing official duties, following detention of two earlier this year.



 
But Turkey swiftly denied having granted such assurances in the affair that has tested relations since the two local employees of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul were held on suspicion of ties to last year’s failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan.



The United States suspended visa services at its missions in Turkey in October and Turkey reciprocated. In November, Washington said it was resuming limited services upon getting assurances on the safety of its local staff.


“Based on adherence to these assurances, the Department of State is confident that the security posture has improved sufficiently to allow for the full resumption of visa services in Turkey,” the U.S. Embassy in Ankara said on Thursday.

It said the United States continued to have concerns about the two employees detained.


Turkey, while announcing the end of restrictions on the issue of visas to U.S. citizens, took issue with the U.S. declaration.


“We do not find it right for the United States to claim it had received assurances from Turkey and misinform the U.S. and Turkish publics,” the Turkish Embassy in Washington said in a statement.



Turkey’s lira firmed to 3.78 against the U.S. dollar after the statement, its highest level since Oct. 31, and the main share index BIST100 climbed 2.08 percent to reach its highest closing level ever.


Relations between the two NATO allies have become strained in the last year with Turkey angered by what it sees as the U.S. reluctance to hand over Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for the coup attempt in July of 2016.


Turkey was further annoyed by U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.


More recently, Turkey took a leading role in the United Nations to pass a resolution denouncing a U.S. move to recognize Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.

A Putin-aligned municipal deputy got it struck down by court on technicalities (violation of procedure) and a clear intent to sneak up a protest meeting.

Instead of at least trying to get a proper permit, the guy went ahead anyway, despite prosecutor's warning.


Can someone answer a serious question for me? To which extent is the liberal opposition in Russia driven by Jewish intellectuals?

> The murder hit Russia’s sizable Jewish intelligentsia particularly hard because “nearly all the leaders of the liberal opposition are either fully Jewish or have Jewish background,” said Michael Edelstein, a lecturer at Moscow State University and a writer for the Jewish monthly magazine L’chaim. “His murder is the low point in a process that started about two years ago which has left the Jewish intelligentsia and its milieu feeling more uneasy than ever before in post-communist Russia.”

This is taken from the [Jerusalem Post.](http://m.jpost.com/Diaspora/Nemtsov-murder-reminds-Russian-Jews-of-lingering-anti-Semitism-392752)

Yashin is a Jewish gentleman, so was Nemtsov, and several other opposition figures cited in the Western media. Does this reflect a more general tendency?

If not, is Putin antisemitic? Could these arrests have anything to do with his 2013 comment that [the first Soviet government was mostly Jewish](https://www.timesofisrael.com/putin-first-soviet-government-was-mostly-jewish/)? Could he be (irrationally) afraid of a Bolshevik revolution 2.0?

Hopefully nobody will misconstrue my comment as offensive. This is a question I’ve been meant to ask, and this latest development makes it more pressing in my mind. 

Thanks Reddit.

Edit: wow, the downvotes started pouring fast. Why? Anyway I’m leaving the comment up, perhaps I’ll get an erudite answer, I don’t mind spending karma capital to further my education ;)

I am not American and so the urging by this Church of England Bishop is rather surprising to me in that he has wandered into someone elses lane by saying anything to Americans about how they have voted. He did the same thing in England and told his English flock how to vote during Brexit. He must be looking for attention or seems to have a huge appitite for politics. He does answer to the Queen of England who is the head of his religion but perhaps he should retire from his station and just run for politics instead. Even Bishops can be a little narcassitic and look for attention even if it is across the pond.
Why is he generalizing like this? Not all Christians blindly support him. Ugh.

Sometimes, they bring fresh fish, which is regarded as a mark of good fortune for the family that receives it.[3] They are also highly knowledgeable about medicine, and legend states that they taught the art of bone setting to human beings.[9][24][25] Due to these benevolent aspects, some shrines are dedicated to the worship of particularly helpful kappa.[26] There were also festivals meant to placate the kappa in order to obtain a good harvest, some of which still take place today. These festivals generally took place during the two equinoxes of the year, when the kappa are said to travel from the rivers to the mountains and vice versa.[3]

Edit: I defer to jw934's far-more-plausible explanation, drawn from his own experience:

>When I go camping in the backcounty of Algonquin Park, I always paddle my canoe out to the middle of the lake to collect water in my water bottle to avoid the forest litter floating near the surface.

Suggesting that the pottery being found were accidentally dropped overboard, centuries ago, while their owners gathered pure drinking water.

So, what evidence would confirm or deny this hypothesis?

A careful examination with GoogleEarth shows lake borders that are mostly vast, flat expanses. This suggests that creeks and rivers were unavailable as sources of fresh water to the people living close to the lake for fishing.

So gathering water from the middle of the lake would have to have been a daily ritual. No?


 

I'll resist downvoting, as it is an interesting article, but when large well-funded media outlets publish articles about archaeological finds, artifacts, discoveries, etc, is it too much to ask for a picture of the thing? 

I think if I wrote that article in college I'd get a grade-point dropped for the omission. Maybe they couldn't get the rights to an image, but couldn't they get the rights to *any* other pottery from the lake? Do they have no one on staff that can turn out a line drawing? 

Perhaps its all cost-vs-clicks now - ""sure, we could get the picture, but how many more clicks would that *really* get us""?

Relevant bits from the article. The first quote (in the first paragraph of the article) seems like a reasonable stance to take. I believe we have a similar system here in the US. 

The second quote shows that this program is already in place, and the proposal is to reduce benefits to increase pressure on people to not be so picky about getting a job. 


> Far-right National Front spokesman Jordan Bardella questioned a policy of ""generalised suspicion"" towards the unemployed, saying the government should instead focus on rooting out ""notorious cheaters"".

This one confuses me a bit, because I'm not really all that informed on French internal politics. In the US Far-right are usually the ones that have the opposite views mentioned above. 

Aside from that though, I agree with this view. 

Adjusting the proposal to gradually decrease the benefits overtime instead of a straight up cut for the first offense would hurt unlucky jobless less, while increasing pressure as time continues for those abusing the system.
I have a family member who routinely picks projects that will be over in several months so he can go traveling, diving, and play computer games for the rest of the year. He'll collect unemployment and ""wait on a callback"" after deliberately placing himself so low on the list it would be unlikely he'd get a job even after four months.

He was a hard worker for so much of his life, I don't quite get it. Maybe after some people's midlife crises they gain true idgaf attitudes.
If you're ABLE to work, you should be. Benefits should be for things such as a reasonable occupation transition, people who cannot work due to any logical but exceptional circumstance, like being medically unfit for work or otherwise. 

In Australia there are a vast number of people who are taking the fucking piss out of our benefits system. I personally know of someone who has 3 children under the age of 16 and a fiance of 13 years. My friend is receiving about $920 p/fortnight and his girlfriend is receiving approx $1,500 p/fortnight. Both are very employable. 

Why havnt we made it harder to be eligible for benefits already. Not just down under. But all around the globe?

If this is based on a national average then one factor in declining IQ is modern medicine. A few groups that can drag down national IQ:

1. Often babies that wouldn't have survived birth without significant modern medical intervention also end up with lifelong cognitive problems. 

2. People who have would have in past died from a severe brain trauma are now living but with a reduced cogitative capacity.

3. As the population ages cognitive abilities decline due to aging. A group of 30 year old people are going to have a higher IQ than a group of 90 year old people.  

4. It takes longer for people to die now and often during the dying process, that now can take months to years, a person cognitive abilities decline too.  

I'm not suggesting that it fully explains the IQ drop but I think it does play it's own role. 

EDIT- I didn't read the article since I wasn't going to spend $35.00 for the privilege. The only thing that I did read was the free summery.

It's probably declining in a lot of places to be  honest. A lot of people in the First World don't care for books anymore. Sad. 
Since no one appears to have read even the abstract, here you go:

>The IQ gains of the 20th century have faltered. Losses in Nordic nations after 1995 average at 6.85 IQ points when projected over thirty years. On Piagetian tests, Britain shows decimation among high scorers on three tests and overall losses on one. The US sustained its historic gain (0.3 points per year) through 2014. The Netherlands shows no change in preschoolers, mild losses at high school, and possible gains by adults. Australia and France offer weak evidence of losses at school and by adults respectively. German speakers show verbal gains and spatial losses among adults. South Korea, a latecomer to industrialization, is gaining at twice the historic US rate.

>When a later cohort is compared to an earlier cohort, IQ trends vary dramatically by age. Piagetian trends indicate that a decimation of top scores may be accompanied by gains in cognitive ability below the median. They also reveal the existence of factors that have an atypical impact at high levels of cognitive competence. Scandinavian data from conventional tests confirm the decimation of top scorers but not factors of atypical impact. Piagetian tests may be more sensitive to detecting this phenomenon.

Ahhh, yes.  The proverbial ""Little Guy"".  The ever-popular, always-effective, never-fail sob-story of every politician and oligarch since the Industrial Revolution.

Yes.  Yes, they *are* hurting ""The Little Guy.""

That's the whole point.

You see, we've tried everything else.

We tried bargaining.  Things got worse.

We tried working within the system.  Things got worse.

We tried voting.  Things got worse.

We tried protesting without disruption.  Things got worse.

Why did they get worse?  I'll let you in on a little secret?

The ""Little Guy"" has been kept so busy trying to survive, that they [**NO LONGER BELIEVE**] that they have any power.

But they *do* have power.  Lots of it.  Why else do you think anyone bothers with elections and public relations campaigns?  Why do you think political action committees spend so much money and effort on swaying public opinion?

It's not because ""The Little Guy"" doesn't have any power, I assure you.

Yes.  They are going to make you late for work.  And that's actually a key part of what they're doing, you see?  If you're late for work, that means **work stops.**  That means your employer **loses money.**  And that means those with all the money, **also lose money.**

And those with all the money do **not** like it when they lose money.  They don't like that at all.

So yes.  They are going to make you angry.

And yes.  They are going to make you waste petrol and generate CO2 while you sit in your car and text your boss that you're going to be late.

They're doing it because nothing else has worked, and they're hoping to cause enough disruption to the profit model, that it causes real, genuine pain up and down the chains of commerce and politics.  

Because most of you lack the motivation to do anything, or worse, lack the *belief* that you can do anything.

So they're doing it for you.
Asian countries are doing better job to cop with air-pollution than other countries.
As stopping climate change is getting more urgent, and the people who want to save the world are becoming desperate, we are going to see more of these ""direct actions"". Wouldn't surprise me if eco-terrorism will be getting more common soon.
One gallon of gas make 24lbs of CO2, these asshats hold up London's busiest roads delaying motorist forcing them to burn more fuel. I think they want global warming, I can't think of a better way to get 1,000's of pounds of extra CO2 in the air any faster.
We don't have time to go through the kind of process that civilized countries do, considering the various options and actions to be taken.

We only have time to do what I want, right now.

The Israeli government is doing to the Bedouins, and other indigenous Israeli Arabs, what the U.S. government once did to Native Americans. It would appear they are employing the same sort of *eminent domain* rationale to justify their actions.

We desperately need the same kind of consumer protection laws that France has.
I posted an article about this to /r/news thinking it was just sort of extra ""apple is shitty"" news, not thinking too much about it.  I came back the next day to 145 thousand upvotes lol.  I think this irritated some people, not just myself. 

If my wife and I had known we could just replace the battery to get her phone to act normal again, we would have.  Apple should have been upfront and open about it, but they were sneaky, and once it was proven with verifiable tests, they were basically forced to come out and admit it but tried to dress it up as a feature.  OF COURSE Apple fanboys were saying how great this feature was and how they accepted Apple's word and blah blah blah.

The bottom line is Apple did this to herd people into buying newer phones.  They snuck the changes in iOS updates to make people think the OS itself had simply become too burdensome for their phone. Multiple posts prior to this news coming out reveal some users had already discovered the relationship between a new battery and restored performance, and we don't see anything like that with ANY OTHER PHONE.  This is strictly an Apple thing.

I really don't think Apple should get off the hook the way so many are willing to do.  Companies need to be held accountable for stuff like this, not be given blind loyalty no matter what.  This isn't a feature, it's Apple screwing you.  


Is this a crime in France? Sometimes I just get so envious of a functioning govt.
Nice but when is this going to happen for the rest of phone manufacturers? I'm pretty sure Sony, Samsung, LG, etc do the same.

THANKS BUT NOT HELPING ME TEN DAYS OUT FROM QUITTING
sorry I'm a little on edge 
I hope they find a way to make a drug that doesn’t have any side affects to the brain and can suppress the addiction without constant use of the drug. But of course it’s not going to be a one time use drug fir money’s sake
I started out only smoking when I drank. That's how I became an alcoholic.
Nicotine is pretty tricky. I vaped for a year, and had to go from 18 mg to 1.5 mg e-liquid eventually to quit. Even at 1.5 mg of nicotine, it wasn’t hard to quit, but sort of annoying for about 3 days.
ISnt that what Chantix does? blocks the receptors.

Shit works though. Smoked 12 years,  started it and quit after the first week of pills. Been smoke free 3 years now.
There already exists an extremely effective method of quitting smoking that just doesn’t seem to catch momentum. Read the book Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Quit Smoking. Says the willpower method is torture. His method requires zero willpower. Best eight bucks I ever spent.
Isn't this just what Chantix does?    

Though if they could make a drug that doesn't give me horrible nightmares like Chantix that would be great.

Such a mystery. Perhaps it was old mister Henderson so he could get control of the diamond mine, Scoob?
It’s not much of a mystery. YouTube has been censoring videos for political reasons here in the US and censoring on behalf of governments abroad for a long time time now. I thought it was common knowledge.
How is this news, for real??
Youtube routinely takes down videos for false copyright claims, and other.

Everything with the word  ""Putin"" now gets upvoted in the reddit's Russia frenzy?
Since all the other threads about him are now over a day old and it's impossible to get noticed, I'll post it here.

Navalny is great at protesting. He mastered the art of riling people up on social media - to the point where a lot of people go to protest in their cities despite the fear of getting arrested and spending the night at a police station. He's responsible for keeping the corruption a relevant and popular issue throughout the last 5 years and for that, I'm still supporting him in that role.

However, as an actual politician he's awful. Since his presidential campaign is now basically over (as he's been officially barred from running), I can say that he never amounted to anything more than a blind protest vote. Once he initially announced he was going to run, I had high hopes, but his platform (which he detailed on his official website) uncomfortably reeks of Trump. Zero specifics, over-reliance on slogans, flat-out unrealistic proposals (like doubling the healthcare budget or tearing down the judicial system to rebuild it from the ground up), nationalist policies (like banning the Middle East immigrants from moving in for work), and, what hit me the most - no mention of foreign policy plans. At all. 

He seemed to believe that once he deals with the corruption, everything else will sort itself out. People will enlighten and stop believing propaganda, the budget will increase tenfold to allow for his Napoleonic ""repair"" plans, the international community will welcome Russia back with open arms, etc. He's simply inexperienced in political dealings, and we see what happened with the US once they elected an inexperienced leader.

Also, we, as voters, always run the risk of electing him and seeing him turn into the same evil he swore to destroy. It has happened far too many times in our history to just dismiss.

Ironically, now that his political ambitions are out of the way, he can focus fully on what he does best - disruption. He's already announced that his campaign is now a boycott campaign - protest against a farce election by not showing up. Even though he was technically defeated, I think that was a blessing in disguise both for him and for the people. He's far more effective working from the outside than trying to get in.
I'm guessing the video got flagged by youtube's algorithm and taken down. It just seems a lot more likely.

Just a matter of time until Putin's biggest critic disappears too.

A catastrophe for North Korea that is.

In two days their military would be nearly wiped out. It's not like taking on China or Russia, it's more like taking on New Jersey. The air force would decimate NK in short order.

Makes sense. WeChat is already used by all Chinese people for literally everything.

People are acting like this is some dystopian thing, but it’s really just that **everyone** in China uses WeChat for **everything** already - it’s like Facebook combined with PayPal, combined with Apple Pay, combined with a messenger app, combined with Instagram.

The Chinese government is already monitoring their citizens WeChats and has full access to the records (and has had them for years). This is just to make things easier so people don’t have to carry paper documents with them.

That’s not to say that the Chinese government isn’t oppressive or controlling, but this specific change **isn’t**.

Source: been to China, have used WeChat extensively, have seen it used for literally everything.
How ironical. The internet and social apps, intended to give people a tool for freedom and democracy, is now the government's most powerful means to control its people. Especially in China. Soon worldwide. 
To my knowledge Wechat is also very popular in SEA. 

Will Wechat be restricted on Chinese territory ? What will happen to westerners using this app ?

Dumb idea.  Agreeing to rent-out property should not be a perpetual agreement.  This will only reduce the number of available rental properties and put increased financial pressure on those who are most vulnerable (aka those who need to rent in the first place).

Only way to consistently benefit renters is to increase the number of rentals spaces through construction and tax breaks for renovations.
Crazy international politics opinions or not if Corbin's keeps focusing on the problems successive Torie governments caused ( with the aid of a water down Labour party ) he will be the next PM. 

With a Corbin, a Sanders and a still somewhat Social Democrat EU we can actually invert the decline of our species.

That's a step that would benefit the vast majority of people, however as long as lower-class and middle-class people keep voting against their very own interest this won't happen.

Sheesh. Blaming the programmers is terrible. 

Getting the numbers right is the job of the flight control team in the TsUP Mission Control - Moscow, specifically the ascent officer, with the final word give by the Flight Director. 

The Center is called the Tsentr Upravleniye Polyotom, TsUP, pronounced ""tsoop."" Most of the cosmonauts call it ""Moskva"" (Moscow) just like astronauts call the NASA Mission Control Center at Johnson Space Center ""Houston.""

Inside TsUP, there are five rows of consoles for specialists who monitor the systems and progress of each mission. The Flight Director position is usually filled by a former cosmonaut.

""Programmers"" write the software; the flight control team is responsible for the numbers they put into the software, and for checking and double-checking their accuracy and precision.

I suspect it's just some sub-par journalism from the Guardian. They probably used the wrong word, translated from Russian.

500 cases of toxic shock syndrome in Japan with a population of 127 million is nothing to be afraid of. Click-bait bullshit is click-bait bullshit, thanks Newsweek!

This article is SO CONFUSED! They talk about flesh-eating bacteria. Then they name the bacteria and say it causes common strep throat, necrotizing fasciitis and one or two other things... and end up calling it flesh-eating bacteria. It's all those things, but it's not at any time exclusively one of those things!

Hamas took power in Gaza and has been enforcing Islamic law on the populace since 2007. They started banning dogs from public locations because dogs are deemed to be unclean. The problem is they have plenty of dog owners in Gaza so they were outraged by this.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hamas-bans-dog-walking-gaza-strip-n774586

The Palestinian Authority (The West Bank) stopped paying for Gaza's electricity. This was done to pressure Hamas to release power. It left Palestinians in the dark.

Abbas (Palestinian President) famously stole one of the last options the Palestinian people had for freedom from their situation. Jordan had started giving out citizenship to Palestinians and thus giving them a chance to move to Jordan. Abbas ordered Jordan to stop doing this but not before he accepted Jordanian citizenship for himself and his children.https://www.upi.com/Abbas-receives-Jordanian-citizenship/49261297257434/

What a horrific idea, using taxes to actually attempt an improvement in society. Even if it won't single handedly stop obesity, which was never the point, it might be one part of a policy that can 
Philly.com published a synopsis of how the tax has fared so far in Philadelphia. I don't have the link handy but it should be easy enough to find for those interested in the subject.

Spoiler...the studies paid for by industry cry doom whereas the independent studies note that while the tax has cut into soda sales, it hasn't cut into store sales overall.
Well we all know South Africa’s biggest issue is still sugary drinks
People who are saying oh wow good for South Africa... this is South Africa we're talking about ... hello!!

I say this as a South African that realistically, this is gonna end up fuelling corruption and is just another reason for high placed people to grease palms. This wont curb surgery drinks. In a country where obesity levels cannot be properly measured due to cultural influences on the perception fatness has, I don't believe sa will get any less sugary.

We had sugar adverts when I was growing up, like for Hullets or Illovo... a child singing 'I LOVE SUGAR' 

KZN, sugar cane country where sitting with a nice piece of sugar cane, a panga,  and spitting fibres all over the place is normal. 

SA fucking LOVES sugar. Koeksisters and malva pudding. Sweatmeats at Diwali. Those Dirkie tubes of sweetened condensed milk marketed to kids.

When 1st world people see the E numbers in SA products it's an eye opener of how regulation is less when it comes to additives.

A few years ago the government threatened to tax braaing. To those who don't know, braaing/shisa nyama or the not quite the same English word barbecue, is a pillar and cornerstone of South African society. The braai tax was meant to cut emissions. I mean come on? Compared to all the unchecked factories who do their illegal chemical releases at night? Pffft. Utter bull.

These are get rich quick schemes to the corrupt elite. I don't think you guys understand the degree to which corruption permeates our society. Is a rot and a framework at the same time, so as it destroys moral order it props itself up. 
Drivers license? You can buy one.
Speeding ticket? Bribe 
Passport issues? Bribe
Illegal number and size fishing catches? Cut and bribe?
Drug dealing? Bribes.

Every single aspect of our culture you can expect some kind of extortion, bribery and blatant corruption. It doesn't shock anymore. It's normal and it's expected.


Good, the Tax in Mexico has done wonders to help curb obesity.
Yeah who the fuck else is gonna pay for the President 10 wife's and 109 children!
good idea. If there is one thing I am more than fat its cheap.
The issue is not so much sugary drinks, as it is poor nutrition due to the high price of food for most people. 

Eating pap and white bread are other reasons why there is an issue.


I used to work at Pepsi, the idea of taxing soda in the United States seems like such an obvious move.

Is Christmas a bad time to talk about left-wing stuff like helping others, giving instead of taking, and caring about strangers?

This is kinda stupid.  
I'm no christian but i've not heard anything different in the gospel (on tv and in the news) this year. the church takes the stance of the church! Christianity is neither a driving force of the left nor the right. I can remember enough debates where the church would take the conservative side (basically any lgbt issue) and now they're advocating a more leftist attitude towards immigrants. The church is just as political as those who it's speaking too and the believers will pick the issues that are important to them, it's not like after every sunday or holiday people come streaming out of the church, protesting for what they've heard in there.
""Die Welt"" is really Right Wing, similar to the ""Der Stuermer"" (Nazi Newspaper)

Kinda like Beetlejuice, huh?
Regardless of what was already there, it's no surprise that a foreign country would want to establish a military base in a country that has just been torn apart by a civil war. Especially if the two parties are allies and wish to support eachother. I mean the last thing they want is another civil war and if it was to happen again it would end a lot faster and be a lot cheaper this way.

Military drills are used to catch a country by surprise.

In 1967 Israel had been running massive air raid drills where the planes would fly every morning, then go under radar by flying low as Arab sat their entire armies at the border in massive numbers performing their own drills. Except one day in June it wasn't a drill- and the planes disappeared from radar only to show up and decimate Egypt and Syria's air forces completely while still on the ground. 

In 1973 Arab countries held drills all the time, until it wasn't a drill and they attacked- catching Israel by surprise and transporting thousands of troops and tanks over the Suez Canal in 24 hours before Israel had even mobilized.

There's no doubt that China is doing this to keep Taiwan on its heels and eventually complacent so that if it ever needs to invade, it will do so on favorable terms. IMO, if I was Taiwan I would invest in a nuclear arsenal ASAP.
Just a note, but Taiwan practices too.

Edit: the downvotes, the Chinese are attacking. TAIWAN NUMBER 1
China is probably the greatest threat to the West. No one seems to consider them an enemy, but they absolutely are.
sigh, China coulnd't do anything against Taiwan anyway. They have no troop transports able to carry out an invasion. They also don't have the air power to do an air invasion. More BS Fake news.

""This train terminates at Trump.""

What a train wreck.
Why is this issue such a big deal? Didn't Israel win Jerusalem in the 6 Day war decades ago? 
A crass political payoff for Trump’s moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, perfectly appealing to Trump’s insecure, inflated sense of himself. The Netanyahu government and the Trump administration, abetted by far-right GOP  extremists like U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, represent two of the most significant obstacles to long-term peace in the Middle East. Plus Trump, Cotton and Netanyahu have all been itching for a war with Iran. 
It's probably trade marked.
Should be named after the people who dies following Trump's decision. No decision is brave when you don't have to deal with any consequences.
It's funny. Christians in the middle east are terrified of retaliation for this move. Other Jewish people in the middle east are terrified of retaliation. And at least a dozen Palestinians have already died. Only group that seems happy is Israel, and we are still struggling to understand why the middle east is so volatile. 


I'm failing to see how this move does anything for relations in the middle east and the world at large. The legitimacy of Israel in the eyes of the U.S. was unquestionable. We spend billions of dollars protecting them. We protect them with the U.N. I don't even understand this move politically. It seems that Israel only gets its theocracy further legitimized in this choice, but that's not really a good thing globally.


Edit: To clarify, I'm not saying the U.S. shouldn't recognize or support Israel.
His brave decision to pander to his evangelical voter base, regardless of the consequences elsewhere. So brave.

While fingerprints are helpful in identifying individuals (although there is no complete central repository - states have no mandate to routinely update and upload their fingerprint data to the FBI - face recognition programs still have a long way to go.

It's honestly painful how backwards and broken the weed laws are in the Netherlands. Coffeeshops are allowed to exist, but not allowed to buy, they're not allowed to have above a certain amount of cash or weed in their stores, nor are new ones allowed to open up. It's really hard to see most of the ''conservative'' U.S grow more liberal regarding cannabis then the country that has Amsterdam. 
This is the biggest loophole in the system, supply. It is legal to possess and sell with a licence but the licence to grow limits you to two plants. How then do they have far more to sell?
We got a (sort of) a problem in Poland, Vietnemese triades, after being busted in other EE countries have come to Poland and set up in-house plantations. 

Probem is (in many cases) - they rent the house sometimes under cover of large vietnameese firm, remove furniture, sometimes get rid of few interior walls (as according to contract) and establish full grown plantation. As vietnemeese community is very hermetic its hard to track them down. Other problem in tracking them down is that they do not sell the product on local market so that local gangs dont track them down. They send it ALL to Netherlands and Germany. 

Workers doing the job are often closed in the houses from outside, often come here illegaly, and paid 3000$ for 6 months of work.

What did they do to ""break it up""?  

Do any of these women still have internet access or access to their children to keep teaching hate to others?

If so then they did not really break it up.  
There is nothing about ISIS in the article.

It says that those women were [Salafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi_movement), a quite popular branch of Islam.

> The majority of the Salafis in the Gulf states reside in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.[10] 46.87% of Qataris[10] and 44.8% of Emiratis are Salafis.[10] 5.7% of Bahrainis are Salafis and 2.17% of Kuwaitis are Salafis.[10] Salafis are the ""dominant minority"" in Saudi Arabia.[11] There are 4 million Saudi Salafis since 22.9% of Saudis are Salafis (concentrated in Najd).[10]
Here is an article on the topic in German: 

http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/salafisten-verfassungsschutz-in-nrw-nimmt-islamistische-frauen-ins-visier-a-1185053.html

Importantly, you'll notice *it is not an ISIS network*, it's a Salafist religious network. In Germany, as in the USA, it's not illegal to be Salafist, because of freedom of speech and religion. All this means is that this group was identified as probably leading people into extremist thought and therefore potentially leading to dangerous action, and will be observed. You'll note that the FBI does the same thing with religious groups in the USA.

For retail it might be a cost/tax paid by the retailer and not paid by the customer.

Social media is not good for the masses. Its actually bad for majority of people.
Obama gets away with pretending to be so naive and above all the reality of politics where he is winning the game by being morally superior. The fact is that while he may imagine he wins all the points for being above it all real politics is going on. 

It's quite lovely to talk about how social media is eroding social discourse while your military has boots on the ground blowing people's brains out and your prisons are bursting at the seams with non-violent drug offenders. Yeah Obama --sure you're so refined and exquisite and easily offended by harsh rhetoric. It seems to me though that the harsh reality you left behind might be a bit offensive as well. 

When asked to take a stand on legalizing marijuana this loser just laughed it off as if it was a joke. When his commerce department slapped trade tariffs on solar panels he acted like he had no say in the matter. While he bombed innocent civilians to please his generals it was all just good ol' boys doing what comes natural. But harsh rhetoric on social media --well that just goes beyond the pale, doesn't it? 
Obama's statement is useless without some examples of the problem.

The high-speed railway station, because it connects directly to the mainland HSR system, was designed with border control in mind so that passengers won't have to disembark at the actual border and then re-embark on the other side.

The Eurostar between the UK and France has the same system, with French immigration on the UK side and vice versa, for the sake of convenience. Having border control inside the station isn't in violation in Basic Law. How this is even news is beyond me.
Sounds like how America runs their ""immigration departments"" in Canadian airports
No. It is akin to a border crossing, and therefore subject to border controls.

Abuse of office, bribery and influence peddling will become less serious offences in Romania if a series of amendments proposed by the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) are voted by the Parliament.

The draft bill proposes a limit of EUR 200,000 under which abuse of office shouldn’t be treated as a crime, arguing that criminal sanctions should only intervene when the damages are “substantial”. It also proposed lower penalties for bribery and influence peddling. The bill’s initiators also want people sentenced to up to three years in jail, people over 60 and those seriously ill to serve their convictions at home.

The PSD MPs also want denouncements to be valid only within six months of the moment when the denouncer found out about the crime.


If that's not a red flag I don't know what is.
>At the beginning of this year, Iordache promoted an emergency ordinance that aimed to partly decriminalize abuse of office by setting a EUR 200,000 limit under which this would not be considered a crime. The ordinance triggered the biggest street protests Romania has seen in over 20 years and the Government repealed it a few days after adopting it.

Locking her in there for 15 years and only feeding her once a day is a pretty cold thing to do.
Like how is this even possible? Like if someone trapped me in a room. Surely there is a way to get out. I mean, a couple of wooden beams and dry wall aren't exactly maximum security now are they?
You need to understand the Japanese mindset for this to make sense. Children aren't their own individual persons. They are an extension of the parents and family line. They are not viewed as a completely separate entity.

Looked at in this context you might understand why some behavior such as this and the honor-suicides are happening.

Note that according to *Israeli law*, the West Bank is under belligerent occupation. While many right-wing Israelis like to say ""there's no occupation"", it's by no means the consensus within Israeli society, or accepted within its legal community.

I hate people. This sickens me and whenever I see videos of bull runs and the scared animals go after people or when I see videos of people trying to kill animals and these animals kill the people, I watch it in glee over and over.

I want all these animals to kill these humans going after them. Not even trolling, I fucking love it 
I don't get this big game hunting. You hardly need to be a great marksman to hit such large and often stationary targets. The local guides do the actual hunting and lead to the animal. Wouldn't it be cooler if you could hit a mouse at a 1000 yards? Tiny game hunting is the extreme end of the sport, elephants and lions are for noobs.
The title of this post is dark poetry.
I have never and will never understand how someone can feel empowered by shooting an animal with a gun when the animal is at a severe handicap. It is like a fully grown man wrestling a 5 year old 

Want a fair fight, fight it with your bare hands one on one, if you manage to win then fucking brag... cunts
Looking at the profit made from canned shootings it does not look like banning the sale of body parts would stop that happening.

They would be - they don't want any perceived threats while they claim huge amounts of international waters as Chinese territory. Japan ramping up their defense is absolutely the right thing to do.
'CHINA has warned another nation not to convert its warships into F-35 stealth fighter carriers — or it will revive the dark days of WWII'

As I recall, Japan was the one bring dark days to China during WWII. 
Fuck off China, saying F-35B are an aggressive movement but constantly breaking maritime law by building artificial island so you can extend your coastal waters. Constantly supporting a NK a country that is just as radical as Iran or IS
Go fuck yourself, Chinese government 
The entire premise that Japan can't have an aircraft carrier because it's premise is inherently offensive is absolutely ridiculous.

(That's why they aren't supposed to have them for those wondering)

Japan is a nation of Islands, some far flung and poorly developed. An aircraft carrier is a core part of a modern navy, and having a floating airfield to protect your nation of islands is pretty damn important. No weapon is inherently offensive. There is no legitamente reason to forbid Japan from having aircraft carriers besides placating China who wants to be the dominating force in the region.

China is just jealous because it's aircraft carrier technology is garbage and it's military technology is not on par with Japan. They don't want anyone in the region being able to challenge their authority, defensive or not. 
[removed]
they are saying aircraft carriers are offensive by nature, they also mention china deployed 2. Doesnt this mean it is reasonable to match their build up?
I remember I said they might do this and a whole bunch of redditors jumped down my throat about how the carrier decks couldn't deal with F35s. 


I think most people are missing the point of China's reaction. They are not dumb, they know exactly such ""warning"" would do nothing to alter Japan's plan, and will very likely be laughed at by western media. But they still air their displeasure publicly for two primary reasons: to give themselves cover against western critisim the next time they increase military spending close to 10% by claiming it's in response of Japan's new toys; secondly, it's to communicate to the domestic audience to justify the share of military budget in government spending - appealing to nationalist sentiment (especially with Japan involved) significantly lowers any public resistance. Contray to popular belief, even though China is a very ""successful"" totalitarian state, it still needs to mind public sentiment to some degree to ensure the smooth implementation of plans such as military upgrade. 

Don't take what they say at face value.

I don't know why this is either shocking or alarming. The US has an [anthrax vaccine,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthrax_vaccines) and most military members and civilian contractors in South Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan are required to get immunized.

>In 1997, the Clinton administration initiated the Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program (AVIP), under which active U.S. service personnel were to be immunized with the vaccine. Controversy ensued since vaccination was mandatory and a perception developed that AVA was unsafe, causing sometimes serious side effects. Mandatory vaccinations were halted in 2004 by a formal legal injunction which made numerous substantive challenges regarding the vaccine and its safety.[24] After reviewing extensive scientific evidence, the FDA again determined in 2005 that AVA is safe and effective as licensed for the prevention of anthrax, regardless of the route of exposure. In 2006, the Defense Department announced the reinstatement of mandatory anthrax vaccinations for more than 200,000 troops and defense contractors. Despite another lawsuit filed by the same attorneys, the vaccinations are required for most U.S. military units and civilian contractors assigned to homeland bioterrorism defense or deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan or South Korea.[25]
[deleted]
There's a lot of explanations for this that very quickly climb the ladder of insanity/horror.

Generally, take everything below with a grain of salt - I'm mostly just suggesting what comes to mind.

*** 

Explanation 1, the simplest one: He was vaccinated for it, yet this is a little unlikely.

Explanation 2, the most likely one: He caught it while interned somewhere very unsanitary and managed to build up immunity.

Explanation 3, the scary one: He was experimented on with some kind of lab-grown bacteria, which is lent merit by the myriad of other shit he had when he was picked up.

Explanation 4, the very scary Infowars-level theory one: North Korea is actively culturing infectious diseases in an attempt to make biochemical weapons (while also possibly trying to immunize their population).

Not at all odd or unusual. Hardly the first time China has sold resources to North Korea while asserting their complete compliance with UN sanctions.
A tale as old as time
Never heard of this publication, how reliable is it?
During the reign of Saddam Hussein there was a period when his country was being held in a similar kind of a blockade or trade embargo. This initiative was spearheaded by the US to punish Iraq's brutal leader for being naughty in general and being a murderous war criminal in particular. 

Now, the effects of said blocked are disputed, some say that Saddam had inflated the statistics to imply a sharp increase in child mortality, but there is little doubt that Iraq was experiencing some major economic troubles as a result. There is also no indication that suggests that even a fraction of splendid lifestyle enjoyed by the leader and the elite was sacrificed to help their struggling citizens. While the poor were struggling for their lives, suffering from diseases while having no access to the medicine, in addition to tyranny also beset by hunger, living in constant fear of getting arrested, tortured and killed by the secret police as well as facing a daily threat of dying from famine or sickness on the street.

This embargo was held for more than a decade, it didn't help to make the regime even a little more cooperative, didn't motivate them to adopt some humane policies or tone down their aggressive and prevocational ways of dealing with the neighbours. Only after the American invasion in 2003 were these sanctions fully cancelled. So basically, one can conclude that this decade-long blocklade wasn't able to influence the policies of the rogue state in any significant way and even failed to cause any real disturbances in the lush and wasteful daily lives of the ruling class. We can even say that all that this long and complex international project ever did was making the lives for hundreds of thousands, especially those who are old, sick or disabled, even more unbearable, painful and bleak. 

Starving these poor Koreans is inhumane and unproductive, a diplomatic solution must be found instead.

Imagine his tolerance to cocaine!!! 
He has antibodies to anthrax in his blood indicating he has been exposed either to the bacterium or to an attempted vaccination.  However, can anyone find a mainstream news source (non tabloid) that says he truly has immunity to anthrax as opposed to having antibody evidence that his immune system has been challenged by the bacterium or parts of it?  I saw something on a Fox site but that hardly counts.
Is that normal to have an immunity to it? 
Worse case scenario:  The DPRK is ready and willing to use chemical and biological weapons.  Best case scenario: The DPRK is unable to feed its troops, making them scavenge for food including rodents that carry the anthrax bacteria.

A newer set of orders in December rang alarm bells. Collomb told regional authorities to set up “mobile teams” to run checks in emergency housing to ascertain the status of migrants. Emergency shelters are considered bedrocks of the French tradition of open arms to those in need and have long been considered untouchable, even by security authorities.
Feel like this article is a written a little single minded, they don't cover all sides with too many ""quotes"" that has nothing to do with it (or out of context) also the title title is misleading. 

France has no migrant struggle, same as quoting Le Pen it's very very misleading as she never produced a plan only opposition.

The number of trips she has done makes it look very much like she is trafficking.
They weren't even her husbands - and they weren't over the counter generics, they were high strength opiates - worth a lot on the black market and she bought them illegally from a friend. 

I have no sympathy whatsoever - too many people in western society tout the line ""if you come to our country you abide by our rules"" - the same is true in reverse.  Always research the law of the country you visit - and never fuck about when it comes to travelling with medication until you understand the laws. 
As much as the post title is trying to make her sound innocent, it seems obvious that she was smuggling.
>""For someone to be found guilty of drug smuggling they have to be aware that they are possessing narcotics,"" Plummer's lawyer, Mohamed Othman, told Reuters.

""I didn't know the drugs I had were illegal.""

Yea, that'll fly.
Let me see if I have this straight-- they weren't legally married, he convinces her to be his drug mule for a drug that is illegal in Egypt. 

He hasn't visited her since her imprisonment, his sister claims he already has a legal wife in Egypt (as well as several additional girlfriends which the U.K. woman knew about) and the U.K. woman and him just signed a document allowing them to stay in the same apartment when she visits him (four times a year).

Tramadol requires a prescription in the U.K., which her father says she didn't even get a prescription for, but just bought them off of one of her friends. 

While in Egyptian jail, the U.K. woman was scammed by two people posing as attorneys out of £10,000 claiming they could get the charges dropped, but then just made off with the cash. 

When the U.K. woman was first detained, she signed a 38 page document in Arabic thinking it meant she would be freed, but she was signing a confession? The Egyptian media has also labeled her the ""Tramadol Tourist""?

Can't verify any of the above, that's just from a few news stories I've read, but this is so ridiculous. If half of what is being reported is true, she just seems like a ridiculously naive and impressionable woman who got conned and caught breaking a pretty serious law. Three years doesn't seem too bad considering she bought an illegal substance into a foreign country where they give the death penalty or life sentences for drug charges. Hopefully, she makes it through her sentence, gets home and wises up a bit.
Lol at her mother's comment. Lamenting that her daughter will be with ""the criminal people"". Most likely majority are fellow humans who got into jams and misunderstandings and got shafted by the courts just as this woman seems to have been.

For everyone arguing about socialism vs other systems. No shit it failed this time, did you know any policy will fail if it's managed piss poorly? Capitalism will fall if there's absolutely no regulations and socialism will fall if you regulate litereraly fucking everything, comeone guys be smarter than this.
The vast majority of Venezuelan oil is low grade and more difficult to refine. They've never had the customer base other oil rich nations like Saudi have, though politics certainly plays a role in that as well. Ironically the US was among their largest customers if I recall correctly.

You'd think even goddam modern refineries that can process their own endless hydrocarbure on their own soil, for domestic use, would have been a worthwhile investment. But apparently not in venezuela. Despite having their entire economy oil centric, and the world's biggest known reserves.

edit jesus fuckin christ

> In his address, Freites said that poor management led to the stoppage of 80 per cent of the country’s refineries. “Only Amuay and Cardón refineries are operative and that is nothing. They produce 40,000 barrels per day and the national demand is over 200,000 barrels of gas per day,” he said.

They need to fix that shit. How the fuck did they fell below the prod of a single of libya's refineries post first civil war ? And those work without maintenance, on no budget, fixed with tape duct and ran by skeleton crews, in the middle of a quasi second civil war. Venezuela has no war, no isis terrorism, no gangs shaking them down for half their prod, and a still existing national oil company & central government.

Curious. How does he have such high approval? Can’t they see through his facade? 



Edit: Ok let me clarify. I understand Putin has complete control of the media and it’s propaganda. 

I’m wondering why, aside from Navalny, who can’t run now, why isn’t there more dissent? 
This guy is a showboat with 0.5% popular support .  Yes, he may have been convicted unfairly in 2013, but the conviction stands as of right now, he cannot run until it’s overturned, just that simple.  If he was serious, Navalny should have had his party run a different candidate and thrown his support behind them.  As it is now he is only good for a meme candidate.

> NEW YORK - A former South American soccer official was acquitted in the FIFA bribery scandal on Tuesday and walked out of the courtroom saying he&#039;s finished with the world&#039;s most popular sport.

> The verdict clearing Manuel Burga, former president of Peru&#039;s soccer federation, of a single racketeering conspiracy charge came days after prosecutors won guilty verdicts on multiple charges against two other former soccer officials.

> Burga&#039;s attorney, Bruce Udolf, said he was sure Burga was innocent but believed he would be convicted Tuesday based on a question from jurors Friday.

Pfft. India has 20x the population of the UK or France (those 2 countries are very similar). This isnt impressive.                                              
But I doubt it's going to happen anyway. India is getting *found out* now. The company I work for is pulling out of India. They just cant deliver. Degrees in engineering are worthless if all they are is fraudulent bits of paper. We hired 30 guys over there this year. So far we have found ONE that is best described as *not utterly awful*. We'r pulling out and investing in Eastern Europe instead. We are not the only ones.
In Developing countries, major trade happens in cash and outside the legal tax framework.

I wonder if Indian economy has already surpassed France and UK. Their massive population is good advantage, they can be poor and still be a large economy.
It's about time, The British looted the Indians for centuries. India GDP was about 23% of the worlds economy at the time they got invaded and was left with nothing by the time they left. I still hear from the old folks of the terror they caused and the evils deeds these people commited.

0,-1.0,,,British Citizen Laura Plummer jailed for three years for smuggling drugs into Egypt,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/26/laura-plummer-jailed-for-three-years-for-smuggling-drugs-into-egypt,1514306424,23,9.85714285714286,">Three years. I can’t believe it.

I can't either.  That's not a big punishment for running drugs to a Muslim nation...which is what she was doing.  Running drugs for your husband is just as illegal as running drugs for a dealer.  They were illegally obtained in the UK and then illegally transported to Egypt.  Pretty open and shut.  ""Daft"" isn't a defense.   Sucks but that's the law.
This whole situation is so sketchy.  She's a 33 year old shop assistant.  They apparently have always lived in different countries and married so they could stay together when she visits Egypt ""several times a year"" and stay in a hotel room.  Then 290 Tramadols are given to her by a friend and she transports them to her Egyptian husband for his (documented) back pain.
>Her sister, Rachel Plummer, told the Guardian: “Three years. I can’t believe it. We are devastated. We had all the evidence showing her innocence.” 

Eeexcept for the part where she totally isn't innocent, and illegally smuggled the drugs into the country. Unless you've got some other definition of innocent we're yet to hear. I mean, even if she really *did* just smuggle in the drugs to help her husband deal with his back pain, she still smuggled drugs. 

>She said she was rushing to visit her sister in Egypt as soon as possible: “I can’t believe this is happening. It’s so unfair.”

... No it's not. You broke the law. It's entirely fair. 

>Turner called Plummer’s sentence a “massive blow” to her family. He said it was clear that the “decent, honest and hardworking Hull woman” was not a drug trafficker and would not have understood the dangers of taking the substance into the country. 

What even? 

So she's an idiot. That's not really a defense here. Neither is the fact that she's ""decent"" or ""honest"" - although I do find the idea of her being ""honest"" while *smuggling drugs* quite curious. 

>Her family has said Plummer had no idea that what she doing was illegal and was just “daft”. 

That. Is. Not. A. Defense.

Knowing the law is your responsibility. If you're speeding because you missed a sign, you're still speeding. If you're caught smuggling just because you didn't realize the hoard of drugs you were carrying were a controlled substance, you're still smuggling.

>They said she did not try to hide the medicine, which she had been given by a friend, and she thought it was a joke when she was pulled over by officials after arriving for a holiday with Caboo, to whom she has been married for 18 months and who she visits several times a year.

Alright, this settles it then. She's probably just an idiot. But that doesn't make her innocent. In cases like these, ignorance is a crime. She should've known better. She should've checked first. But this whole article reads like Egypt is a nasty and crazy country just for having any laws at all. This one's not on Egypt, it's on her. She should've just called ahead, and not assumed that she could just smuggle potent painkillers all around the globe.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

My bullshit detector went off so many times reading this woman's story.  No woman this dumb would be able to find her way through an airport to board a plane to a foreign nation. 

- If her husband in Egypt has back problems in need of medication, they have doctors in Egypt specifically to prescribe needed medication to Egyptian citizens. 

- Someone *gave* her 290 pills of a controlled substance?  Bullshit.   That's multiple months' supply of someone's legitimate prescription.  Nobody saves 4 months of their legitimate prescription and *gives* it to you.   She bought these from a dealer, she knew what they were and what they were for when she bought them. 

- She didn't know it was a big deal to take these to a foreign country?  Again, bullshit.  She bought them and it wasn't over the counter from her local pharmacy.  It's not like she had 20 Advil. 

- Stop bothering the British government with this bullshit.  You got caught smuggling 290 prescription pills that were not prescribed to you.  That's pretty cut and dry, nothing more to see here.   You're lucky you only got 3 years.  I'm kind of floored by that.  You'd get more time than that in America.  Do your time, learn your lesson.  It's never smart to fly with illegal drugs.  It takes a special kind of stupid to fly internationally with illegal drugs. 
Good. She was definitely smuggling- 290 pills in a country where Tramadol abuse is prominent.  She deserves it.

Her moron family talking about how ""it's not fair"" blah blah- I wonder how many times this woman got away with this and these drugs got out to people who were negatively affected.

She's lucky she didn't end up in one of the country's that carry the death sentence or 25+ years for smuggling.  The defense of her being ignorant to the laws of Egypt is bs.
I hate how her family is trying to garner sympathy and the tabloids are actually eating it up.

People need support on issues like this when they make genuine mistakes, or get busted for possession via blood stream. This girl damn well knew what she was doing, I don't know ANYONE in the UK who isn't aware to  be cautious regarding drugs & middle eastern/arabic/muslim countries. The fact she had to bring them as he couldn't get them in Egypt would be enough to make even someone genuinely unaware, think that maybe this isn't a good idea.

She is taking attention away from people who make genuine mistakes or are treated badly. Egyptian's are 100% in the right here.

Very badly written article. Just look at this:

How on earth do those numbers support the conclusion offered? How can you even think about approval compared to disapproval?

No it doesn't, otherwise the 6-10 cases of anthrax each year in the US would be way more fatal.

80% mortality is the high end of a respiratory infection (the worst kind of anthrax).

What a shitty article.
Report: Normal Canadian dude found to have Anthrax albums.
is this bad?
odd question... but if they loaded a missile with anthrax and our defense system shot it down, would the anthrax still make its way down and possibly infect people? or would an explosion like that burn or destroy the anthrax. 
Anthrax can also be contracted in nature

[ie: last year Russians deployed biohazard units to contain dead animals in the wild that died of anthrax in permafrost, but now as the ice melts they are surfacing]

Anthrax is a remarkable bacteria being able to encase itself in multiple cellwalls, ie it can live for a looooooong time without being in a host, and quite resilient to environmental insults

TL;DR: this NK soldier could have contracted it outside of biohazard facilities.

Bonus: If your luck is bad enough, you can get it in the wilderness. Symptoms are quite different between ingestion and inhalation.
I think I had 12 Doses of anthrax vaccine. Threat has gone way down so not required anymore

Is this approved by the banksters?

oooh! Now it makes more sense.

Check my math please.
3,200 Sq KM / 2.59 SKM/Sq mile = 1235.52 Sq Mi.
5280 x 5280 = 27,878,400 Sq Feet per Sq Mile x 1235.52 Sq MI =
34,444,355,212 Sq Feet / 25,000,000 people = 
1,378 Sq Ft per person,  Alternatively 25,000,000/1235.52 = 20,234 people per Sq Mi compared to New York City 27,000 per Sq Mi this 25% less and there is no central park in Shanghai.   So New Yorkers need to move to get more living space.


 
Probably self-explanatory, but here is ""big city disease"":

Huh, if i remember correctly, shit hit the fan around 2008 or so.
There was executions fucking everywhere, either civilians or other cartels, but it was mostly civilians getting fucked.

Right now we are in a state where its mostly cartel vs cartel killing each other with the collateral damage, still a lot of killing of civilians but still is better than i remember 2008-2010.

From all the stuff in the news, it sounds as if she's got some kind of learning difficulty. Either that, or she's just exceptionally dim.
I'm not entirely sure why this has made headline news in the UK, considering a drug offence in Egypt can be a prison sentence of up to 25 years, or even the death penalty, 3 years seems like the judges have found her guilty but looked into the context of why she was doing it. 

I can't remember the source but the reason they are banned because it is a drug containing opioid analgesics, which are only allowed under Sharia law under strong circumstances. Egypt is mainly governed by Sharia law.

Sickening. Studies have found that there are microplastics in our drinking water and they can literally be found raining out of the sky. Microplastics are building up in the food chain and as apex consumers with long lifespans these microplastics will become concentrated in our bodies. These microplastics can be small enough to penetrate and become resident in an individual cell. 

We don't know what effect this will have on our health as the problem develops. For all we know it could lead to global sterility or something absurd like that. Almost certainly I would expect cancers and other chronic illnesses to increase in frequency. 

Given that we have the technology to convert at least some plastics back into reusable raw material and we are running out of oil, there should be much more effort put into preventing plastic dumping. Such a crazy, stupid world we inhabit.
It's kind of amazing to think that long after we're gone the one thing that will remain is a thin layer in the soil of plastic, to mark our time on earth. 
Right on!  Full steam ahead to the fall of society!

Always ask to double bag your stuff!!
The Earth will rid itself of humans soon enough. Or humans will just rid of themselves with nuclear weapons. Win win
Hopefully the development of plastic eating fungus will save us all.
one thing I been talking to a fellow-engineering buddy of mine for a while about: make a line of products that are fully biodegradable or at the very least no plastics besides bioplastic. Just target the items people tend to throw out the most.

Hey shorten. This is what a real labor leader looks like. Resign.
A very good speech. Hopeful.
People who proclaim that the ""world order"" broken seldom have much notion of what constitutes that order. Instead, they erect a straw dummy and throw mud pies at it. World Orderitis has several symptoms:

* The alleged Order is constructed by conscious design and maintained by coercion. Any notion that the economic or social system exists the way that it does because it has emerged from history, from what people want from their lives and from what happens to work is set aside. It cannot be so.

* The Order is said to be broken because it disadvantages a client group of the sufferer, and more to the point, it doesn't fit in with their theory of How Things Should Be. 

* This conviction is immune from disproof. It is relevant to note today's reports than an egg in Caracas now costs more than a labourer's daily wage. Not one of the Not-the-Order regimes actually work towards any outcome which the Orderitis sufferer espouses: they impoverish, they repress, they divide. Generally, they generate more and not less inequality. 

* The sufferer attributes all progress - in wealth, knowledge, international affairs and geopolitics - in the world to an underground of the virtuous, who *despite* the broken Order somehow keep Right On to the end of the road. Progress, it seems, will out; but none of it is attributable to the dominant system. 

Sad, really. 
Corbyn is an idiot.
Only The citizens of North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba are equal. We should all strive to be as environmentally friendly as they are. Since they are thriving and prospering under socialism, we should all follow their example.

And this is why you can’t have nice things in the military. 

One idiot always fucks everything up for everybody. 
Context: this alcohol ban had only been in place since the Nov 19th accident mentioned in the article. It's not like they changed a long-time policy and suddenly disaster struck. Okinawa has had [the worst drunk driving stats in Japan for the last 27 years](http://www.japanupdate.com/2017/01/okinawa-on-top-of-dui-stats-for-27th-consecutive-year/). 
Probably worth mentioning:

[Japan has notoriously tough (on gaijin) alcohol limits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAoZKECh0KA)

[Okinawa has the worst rate of drunk driving in all of Japan](http://www.japanupdate.com/2017/01/okinawa-on-top-of-dui-stats-for-27th-consecutive-year/) at over five times the national rate (and that, folks, is what we call an ""outlier"")

None of this is an excuse, but I've worked and driven in multiple countries and Japan is about as close to the loosely enforced Islamic standard.

Silver lining: America's not the only country with greedy folks in political positions.
Not surprising, councils hoard money in various forms and frequently invest it in stock markets etc. Pretty sure a number of them lost money when Iceland's banks crashed in '08. Stratford-Upon-Avon council managed to accumulate £130 000 000 ear marked to housing benefit, and Cheltenham borough council lost about £6 000 000 on the stock market. What's tragic is they just put the money to what is meant for it could go into the community. Then again councilors in these parochial towns seem to be entirely self interested and choose policy and spending which directly benefits them. Worcester County Council canvassed to have ring road built. It remains incomplete because the final connecting stretch would by pass councilors homes..or that was the case until recently.
Sounds like a case of Cowan v's Scargill (1985) and the requirement for investment funds to observe fiduciary responsibility above ethical gestures. In this case a challenge was brought against the NUM pension fund by Cowan who wanted it to invest in alternative energy even if doing so might be against the employment interests of the funds membership. 

Cowan won
I know their pension funds do. I designed my councils pension fund yearly report a few years ago and was mildly dismayed to see huge amounts invested in British American tobacco. Might have stopped now, but I doubt it.
Defensive companies that pay decent dividends.

If you invest in ftse index trackers you're doing the same thing.

You're hardly going to invest in services if doing so would harm your investments.

This is the reason for china's haku system. It pervents city from being overly crowded for the well being of the citizens. Otherwise, with 1.3+ billion ppl, any city can be easily overly crowed. 
Won’t this just make real estate in Shanghai even more expensive?
Not long ago the government ruthlessly destroyed homes and kick thousands of officially defined ""low ranked people"" out of Beijing city.(poor blue collar and unskilled workers, it has written on offical documents years ago). One of the officers' speech about ""Need to see bloodbath for the war on low ranked"" got caught on tape and leaked on the internet, it sparked the controversy that people in China compared it to Nazi Germany's method to destroy ghettos and the jews and the government even prohibited non-governmental organization to keep those homeless refugees. Instead of doing housing plan carefully, they choose the old way. Many rational people had high hope on the Chinese government to change, from Mao to a more open-minded lovable government but it seems not. That will not look good for Shanghai. The scariest part is most middle classes and rich people remain silent or even support their move, like one of the friends from China once told me, ""China has too many people"". It is depressing for the youths whose have heart, so please feed us more of those Playerunknown Battleground, Marvel movies and big titties Korean stars.
Up to 3 million people, a city has a good quality of life. Above that it starts getting weird.
When your country is so corrupt it's easier to force millions of people to not live somewhere than to regulate businesses to not fucking pollute.

They need to put that in their manual? Kinda figured that would be implied.
To be honest isn't this like easy $$$ and brownie points for the Police Departments. Instead of going after poor dudes who can't escape bail and are low income why not go after these dudes who make so much money. On top of that I find myself to think that these guys are much easier to crack when interrogated because they have so much to lose than a low income person. 
In other words: “Some people who have jobs also pay for sex”. Shocking.
So employees of big companies got busted offering to pay prostitutes for sex using their company emails. What a clickbait pearl clutching trash article.

Going by the frequency of these sting operations, I find myself contemplating the fact that some significant portion of all Backpage, Craigslist, Grindr, etc ads for sex services are just undercover cops trolling for a bust.

Seems like we have a whole nationwide federally-funded industry of fake sex workers who advertise sexual services for money and then handcuff and jail the people who actually fall for it thinking they are hiring real prostitutes. Hmmm, maybe it takes one to know one.

> Definition of prostitute
prostituted; prostituting 

> ...

> 2 : to devote to corrupt or unworthy purposes : DEBASE • prostitute one's talents
I think we all know this isn’t new nor isolated. They were so matter-of-fact about it that they used their work accounts. 
People who use work network for things like this should be fired for stupidity.

That said, one day I will understand why the presence of a camera magically makes sex for money legal. One day.
Personally, I think prostitution should be made legal. This way, it can be regulated. STDs can be contained. There would be less motivation to kidnap and abuse women. The taxes from brothels would be astronomical. I see no cons.
I am a sex worker living in Seattle. We were not happy to find some of our kind and sweet clients caught up in this.

It's a complicated issue involving illegal immigrants and a few brazen men providing them apartments to work out of and clients to see. The fallout hit the local community pretty hard. SPD knocked out my absolute favorite and safest advertising platform because of a minority of arrogant and foolish men.

It is correct to say that while some of the clients were in high places at local tech giants, many are doctors, business owners, code monkeys, real estate agents, bus drivers, and more. This headline is designed to vilify tech companies and their employees.

And yeah, I always correct people when they email me from their professional accounts. It's not very smart. Sigh.

Water cools when it evaporates. This is why sweating keeps our temperature down. When the air is too saturated with water, our sweat doesn't evaporate and we don't cool.  

When we reach the wet bulb threshold (a balance between temp and humidity), a healthy, athletic, naked, person in the shade, under a fan, in a well-ventilated area can die within hours.

Humidity of 50% with a temperature of 46 C is an example of this threshold. 

Hello people from Darwin.
Many of us will be elderly in half a century. In other words the most vulnerable to extreme conditions. Chances are some us here will die from this. 
As a person who stays in Bombay this frightens me.

During summers, we have days when it's humid and hot. If the humidity is low, and it's warm (which is rarely the case in Bombay), your sweat evaporates quickly and cools you in the process. 
But lately, I've noticed that some summer days are unbearable. If you venture out on these days, you better keep your trips short, and carry water with you because dehydration can happen rapidly.

Thank God and engineers for the miracle of air conditioning.

Edit: Bombay not Bonbay
Shit, Florida and Georgia are unlivable with their insane *98%* humidity. Nothing like stepping out your door into a hot, sticky bath. 

Edit: fuck it, the entire southeast of the US is barely livable. 
We can tell stories and make movies about it, but eventually we're all going to have to realize that we really do need to send Matthew McConaughey into space in search of other livable planets. It's inevitable, and he's the only man to do it.

Well the Korean War never actually ended, we're still just in a very long cease-fire, so I guess that means nothing really changes then?

And China, if you hadn't invaded North Korea to fight the US after the NK forces were defeated during the war, we wouldn't be in this situation, the Korean Peninsula would all be as prosperous as SK is today, and millions of North Koreans would not have been subject to one of the most brutal and oppressive regimes in history.  But, you were busy killing off your own populace by the tens of millions at the time, so propping up a fellow communist regime next door who implemented the same ideology was obviously more important.
LOL. Well it's not like they didn't have time to deal with the issue. Who are they kidding?

I am in Qatar and did not hear news of this. So it may not be true news.

However, the Qatar National Day did just pass and there was no speech given by the leader as was usually expected. Especially with the current, political climate this year.

They might be in high alert these past 2 weeks for some reason.

Either way the news article is clickbait. Turkish troops are in Qatar. You don't say? 
Mohammed bin Salman has been on the world stage for a couple of years, and he's already got a civil war in Yemen, an attempted coup in Lebanon, and an attempted coup in Qatar under his belt. Yet everyone is still sucking his dick because he is letting women drive in 2017.

All horse racing is rigged. (Source: me in a prior job where I stood next to jockeys all day as they discussed who would win). They obviously got behind on their bribe payments.
Horse racing is too easy to rig and that's why I refuse to bet on it. 
Never heard the term supergrasser before now. 

I was also picturing a traditional track, before I watched the video. Like the Kentucky derby.  

The chasing of the horses during the races seemed abusive all on its own. I’ve never really been around horses, but I would be terrified if I was being rode and chased down by people on motorcycles.

> The concept of a universal basic income revolves around the idea of offering every individual, regardless of their existing benefit entitlement or earned income, a non-conditional flat-rate payment, with any income earned above that taxed progressively.

> The independent thinktank Reform Scotland, which published a briefing earlier this month setting out a suggested basic income of &pound;5,200 for every adult, has calculated that much of the cost could be met through a combination of making work-related benefits obsolete and changes to the tax system, including scrapping the personal allowance and merging national insurance and income tax.

To provide some context, this is [down from 74%](https://www.levada.ru/2017/12/25/nostalgiya-po-sssr/?fromtg=1) who missed the Soviet Union in 1999 (before Putin was ever elected), though it's still higher than it was five years ago.
The survey itself is a lot more informative than this article.



>Overall, the percentage of Russians from 2014-2017 who regret the collapse of the Soviet Union fluctuates around the level of 54-58%, demonstrating a limited increase in the percentage of those who regret it (it is worth noting that this is not the highest point since 1992).

>Additionally, changes in public opinion are age-specific.... . These groups (35-54 and 55 and older) are therefore dominated by a sense of regret over the collapse of the USSR and respondents in these groups who “do not regret” it are a minority. 

>It is interesting to note that the index’s most significant increase during 2015-2016 was recorded amongst respondents aged 55 and older, for whom the destabilization of Russia’s relations with western countries and the conflict surrounding Crimea probably brought the Soviet contexts of the Cold War and “bipolar world” back to life to some degree. This is shown to some degree by the table on reasons for nostalgia, where “The fact that people no longer felt they were part of a world superpower” is the second most popular answer amongst “nostalgic” respondents (and received significantly more support from respondents in the 55 and older group), following “The destruction of the unified economic system.”

>Furthermore, the older the respondent, the greater their certainty that the collapse of the USSR could have been avoided.

https://www.levada.ru/en/2017/12/25/nostalgia-for-the-ussr/

I have no idea who said it, but I recall the quote “Those who don’t miss the Soviet Union have no heart; those who want it back have no brain”.  I’m paraphrasing, but I always found that sentiment interesting. 

EDIT- HA Putin said it. 
Such a surprise considering the way Putin dialed up the nationalisim...
How is that surprising?

They went from being fed and oppressed to starving and oppressed.


I remember one Soviet expert saying in the early 90's that Russia will not become the next Germany but something more like Brazil with crappy politicians. That guy knew his shit :) 
A lot of Americans look back fondly (especially those who are too young too remember) on the Reagan administration, even though there were two recessions and the  Iran-Contra scandal which sparked the crack cocaine scourge that raced across America. 
Majority of Russians have forgotten or never experienced life under communism.
This is a common reaction. Before and right After he died, Dictator Francisco Franco was hated in Spain for several years. Then slowly, people forgot what they hated about him, and missed the order and security that his government offered. This has been observed in many countries. I met people who were nostalgic for Franco.

3 cases:

File #1000: Bibi (Netanyahu) received small gifts from Hollywood and business figures - pens, the occasional box of cigars, etc. Like in the US, gifts given to the President are property of the government: but what constitutes a ""gift""? Certainly something like a car or a ceremonial document, but would a regular box of cigars be included in that too?

File #2000: Israel HaYom is a FREE, right-wing newspaper paid for by Sheldon Adelson. People in uniforms give it to you when you're waiting at a red light, coming out of the train station or walking in the city to work. (Like the Metro in NYC.) The Right Wing gets free advertising and the newspaper is super right slanted. Some people told the cops that the publisher of Yediot Achronot, the not-free left-wing newspaper, made a deal to give Bibi some positive coverage in exchange for cutting down on Israel HaYom's distribution and right-wing propaganda. Israel is a small country, and people like that go to the same parties and travel in the same circles. (Like you can assume New Yorkers Trump and Arthur Sulzberger know each other.) Bibi and the publisher do know each other and see each other all the time, but they deny making a deal like that.

Side note for Americans: the Right Wing in Israel aren't a bunch of bible-thumping Jesus-crats, and marriage is a religious issue spanning both sides. The Minister of Health, who is literally a Hasid from Brooklyn, believes in Medical Marijuana and is anti unhealthy food.

File #3000: David Shimron, Bibi's Cousin and personal lawyer, represented ThyssenKrupp when it recently sold submarines to the Israeli Navy. Some people are saying that the deal wasn't negotiated in the Navy's best interests because of who Shimron is. Shimron made some money from ThyssenKrupp for doing the deal (as is appropriate), but people are also alleging that he threw some of that money around to grease the wheels.

 You aren't smart or even thinkers.  If you can't see the huge gap in evolution that exists here on earth from bacteria to man, and you can't imagine the times and distances involved in other potential life out there, you aren't visualizing correctly.  Your mind is literally stunted and boxed up. 

Your thinking could be compared to Medieval Europeans believing they were the center of all things and the most advanced civilation to exist. 

It's been obvious, for decades, to anyone willing to spend some time researching past cases, that vehicles having performances exceeding our understanding of physics are traveling around, and that the policy of most governments is to cover the phenomenon up, with complicity from the elite media.  Some countries are episodically more open about this, for example the Belgian government during the wave of triangular craft sightings in 1989, or the Costa Rican government.

The news here is that the government and the media seem to be less scared to admit or at least talk about these things publicly.

Note the wording on this, is very important. He's not admitting involvement in the drug trade, he's basically saying that the scandal combined with his failed marriage have made him resign. He still maintains his innocence, so his daddy won't be killing him any time soon.

I honestly don't think people realize this is a $285M cut from the UN budget, not US contributions to the UN.
The US pays for 20% of the UN's budget. With japan providing the next latgest at 10% and the combined EU provinding just 30%. In each category of the budget the US is the largest provider. Yet the US is constantly criticised and even condemned for their actitions.

But even at a cut of $285M. The US provided over $8B in 2017. Still leaving it at over $7B a year, and still leaving the US, by far, the largest financial provider of the UN.
Can anyone find where it says the US portion is dropping by $285 million? 

The entire UN administration budget was $5.4 billion for 2016-17.

It's time to approve a budget for 2018-19.

They negotiated a new budget with a cut of $285 million of the entire budget.

Nowhere does it say this cut came solely from the US portion.
For the love of God, why is no one talking about the fact that this was announced as a UN budget cut and *not* a US budget cut. If the US contribution rate stays the same at 22%, then this is a budget cut across the board at everyone's contribution rate.
Sooo, eli5 what exactly is the US funding the UN for

China can go fuck itself. Taiwan is independent.
I am not surprised this sort of war threats come from China - NK learned from China after all.

The entitlement Europeans have towards US resources is ridiculous. Look at how many of you are angry that the US isn’t subsidizing your defense.  If you want to be angry at someone, be angry at your own countries who haven’t met their U.N. commitments for **decades**.

Taiwanese propaganda. This so called “Taiwanese language” is just a localized version of a dialect of Chinese called Min, which are spoken in the province of Fujian, which is the closest province to Taiwan. The official language of ROC is also mandarin
If that is the case then they better be prepare to actually fight for their independence. No democracy was ever given to a country without bloodshed. Sacrifices is a something that you are willing to give for democracy. 

Good luck. 
This appeal to traditionalism or culture is inherently divisive. 

Everyone on earth used to speak in a different language/dialect limited to their small region or county, this is a huge problem in countries like indonesia, india and african countries who have hundreds of languages inside a single country. 

Speaking Chinese or any other major language is a huge advantage to any country, shame really that they're going backwards.

This is exactly like the people in the US who showboat about denying LGBT people services; there is no reason to make that comment, there are infinite ways to accomplish the alleged “goal” of denying service to a class without being openly racist.

In exchange for the release of Fujimori, a group of 10 fujimorist legislators led by Fujimori's youngest son, Kenji, abstained from voting in favor of Kuczynski's impeachment on thursday. In the end, the impeachment fell short by 9 votes. What everyone is wondering now is who negotiated this deal: Kenji or Kuczynski?

Some extra context:

In the 2016 elections, Keiko Fujimori, the eldest Fujimori daughter, very narrowly lost in the second round, but still won the absolute majority of congress seats, while the government party only won 18 out of 130 seats (now down to 16).

In the following 16 months since PPK assumed the presidency, five ministers were forced to resign, including a prime minister along with his entire cabinet. PPK's weak position has only worsened over time, partly thanks to his insistence on avoiding confrontation, especially by discarding the ""nuclear option"": if two cabinets are forced to resign following a vote of no-confidence by congress, the president is entitled to dissolve the congress. Completely unchallenged, Keiko's party is in control of all the major comissions in congress, including the Budget, Ethics, Fiscalization and Education comissions.

Things got a lot more complicated thanks to [Operation Car Wash / Lava Jato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Car_Wash). To no one's surprise, almost every ex-president is implicated in some capacity in Odebrecht's massive corruption network. One of them is in jail awaiting trial, another one is in the US to avoid extradition, etc. According to Marcelo Odebrecht himself, Keiko's 2011 electoral campaign was financed by Odebrecht as well, but this has been largely ignored by the Lava Jato investigative comission, which is controlled by the fujimorist majority. Last week, a document arrived to this comission which revealed that a company owned by Kuczynski had received payments from Odebrecht 12 years ago, while Kuczynski was Minister of Finances. Two days later, the motion for the impeachment vote due to ""permanent moral incapacity"" was passed, without giving Kuczynski enough time to prepare a defense.

I'm not going to go in detail about the specifics of Kuczynski's involvement with Odebrecht. He didn't sign any of the contracts, but he lied to the press repeatedly in the previous months about this. He probably did know his company was doing business with Odebrecht, but maybe he didn't know that that constituted a conflict of interest since he's a businessman, not a politician. It hasn't been proven he pulled strings to benefit Odebrecht either, so due to the lack of evidence many people consider this impeachment vote was very rushed, disproportionate, and likely a power play by Keiko to seize even more power.

Keiko's party is currently under investigation by the chief prosecutor's office because of irregularities in their campaign finances and suspicions of money laundering. The prosecutor raided two offices of Keiko's party earlier this month, and in retaliation they filed a motion to sanction the prosecutor for supposedly subverting the constitution. A few days later, they suspiciously filed a similar motion against the Supreme Court because of their ruling in an unrelated case. In a single month, the fujimorist majority has threatened the Chief Prosecutor's Office, the Supreme Court, and now the Presidency of the Republic.

Because of all these things it started to look like Keiko was orchestrating a coup to stop the investigations against her, and so many legislators that initially were in favor of impeaching Kuczynski changed their mind when they realized they would become accomplices to a coup. After Kuczynski announced that both of his VPs would resign if he was impeached (which would result in the fujimorist President of Congress assuming his office and calling for early elections) things got a lot more complicated. Would the people re-elect a party that ousted the president in such an unprecedent way? Would the fujimorist party rig the elections? How much damage can a fujimorist president do in 6 months (besides releasing Fujimori)?

The pardon to Fujimori is a delicate subject. The majority of the population supports it, it's been formally requested many times over the years but always denied because no one wants to be the president that released an ex-dictator that commited dozens of crimes against humanity, it would be political suicide. Even Keiko promised she would not release her father if she won the elections.

Anyway, on the day of the impeachment vote, Kenji Fujimori stepped out of her sister's shadow and surprised everyone. He has always avoided scandals and isn't linked to all the shady businesses her sister's allegedly involved in, such as money laundering, being financed by a drug trafficker, buying votes in poor areas, ""ghost donations"", etc. Many analysts think Kenji may have realized her sister and her inner circle are damaged goods, and that his ""clean"" image and loyalty to his father will help him rise as a favorite for the 2021 elections. In any case, he became a ""hero of democracy"" on that day, and potentially ended the fujimorist absolute majority.
The elitist class of men attempting to shield one another from the justice of the people. No human being is better than any other human being.

This shouldn't happen...
It is really a shame for those of us who still believed in President Kuczynski. Now we know that things haven’t actually changed at all.
Peruvians politics is a oligopoly
I met a Peruvian girl once and asked her about Fujimori.  She told me that her dad loved that guy. 
These are some very oddly *not* Peruvian sounding names. Kind of unusual
guerrero unbanned, ppk unimpeached, Fujimori pardoned....

and still prosor will never get Gaben's mercy
These are some sci-fi set in 2150 type names, pretty cool.
Whatever his failings, the presidency of Fujimori represented a watershed in Peru. Before, the sierra was hard to reach, primitive, insular; ravaged by the Sendero and the army. Lima was ringed by pueblos jovenes made up of the millions who fled the conflict, the streets were full of garbage and the pavements unusable for the ambulantes. After Fujimori the war was over, the army reformed and the police brought under control. (No more PIP!) The slums were still there, but people had tenure on their land, water and drainage, power and transport became available and the rule of law began to penetrate. Today, many are formal suburbs with tarmac roads, shopping centres and three story brick houses. Lima is clean, garbage has all but disappeared and security has improved. 

There's a village in the Sierra Blanca that i used to visit in the 1980s by mule. It had nothing that was not made locally, save a few plastic buckets. Just a few peopel spoke Spanish, crudely. After Fujimori, it has a tarmac road, a daily bus service, a health post, a microwave tower and cellphones, schools and shops. It exports everything from Eucalytus wood to meat to Lima, and many of its young people live and work int he capital. Everyone under thirty speaks Spanish and some have rudimentary English.  
Why do all the prezies of Peru have non-Spanish surnames?

> Earlier in the week, another tropical storm left more than 50 people dead and 31 others missing, mostly due to landslides, and damaged more than 10,000 houses in the central Philippines.

> Among the areas battered by the latest storm was Marawi, a lakeside city in Lanao del Sur that is still recovering from a five-month siege by pro-Islamic State group extremists that left more than 1,000 people dead and displaced its entire population of about 200,000 people.

Culture Minister Miri Regev said: “When I watched that, I felt humiliated, I felt crushed”. She called the incident “damaging to the honor of the military and the state of Israel.” She was echoing her own words from 2015, when Ahed also appeared in a viral video, wrestling a masked Israeli soldier, who was holding her little brother in a headlock and pressing him down on a rock, his broken arm in cast. Then Regev was “shocked to see the video this morning of Palestinians hitting an IDF soldier,” adding that, “It cannot be that our soldiers will be sent on missions with their hands tied behind their backs. It’s simply a disgrace!….We must immediately order that a soldier under attack be able to return fire. Period.”

This is just a clickbait title. ""Fear"" is a very strong word. Worried about Trump? Maybe. Fear? I don't think so. Nowhere in the article there's an actual source for this statement. It only quotes some American reporter who lived in Korea for 4 years. Hardly representative of what actual Koreans think, I'd say.

The article also claims Trump is ""despised"" and anti-American sentiments are bigger than anti-North sentiments, but that is just not true. [According to a poll in March](http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2017/03/13/0200000000AKR20170313080400033.HTML), Trump was the most popular among the leaders of the US, Russia, China, Japan, and North Korea. 19.1% replied in favor of Trump while 8.5% chose Xi Jinping, the runner-up. Only 1% chose Kim Jong Un. But of course according to the article, all Koreans must ""despise"" Trump because there were a few protests in Seoul.

Do you know why there aren't that many protests against Kim Jong Un? Because there's no fucking point. Everyone already hates him so there's no one to protest against. There's no North Korean embassy in the South. The Kim family never visits. Kim Jong Un is a foreign dictator who would never care about your opinion. Why even bother? The US has a much bigger presence in South Korea, so of course anti-US protests tend to be bigger than pointless anti-North protests.

All in all, it's a poorly written article that doesn't cite any actual facts.
Let’s be real, South Koreans are so used to NKs bullshit that it doesn’t really faze them. 
This is Trump's 10 dimensional chess move. Scare the S.Koreans so much that they reunify with N.Korea to avoid getting attacked.

You would have to be truly indoctrinated to a blend of media-built hysteria to honestly be more afraid of Donald Trump than someone who literally launches ICBMs over nearby countries on a monthly basis.

South Koreans specifically get a ""pass"" because they live in a bubble where they have internally minimized the reality of the threat on their border.

Still, nobody has mandatory military service because of Trump. In fact, millions less have to do service because of the US military...

You can sing praises of the Romans or the Persians and nobody cares.
Well, considering the statistically signifigant tendency of countries that were British colonies to transition to consolidated democracies with highly developed economies, it wasn't without long term benefits.

Science doesn't concern itself with moral judgements, only why certain things happen. Scientifically speaking, states that embraced their colonial heritage faired better than those who did not, in part because of the difference in hostility indegenous forces posed to the colonial power.

There is a difference between a constructive colonization (one in which the governing power established political institutions, trade relations, ect.) and extractive colonization (typically bloody due to extreme hostilities between natives and the colonial power. In this case, the goal is to get in, take the resource you're after, and get out as quickly as possible). This has been linked to the difference in levels of economic and political development between former colonies, with the former fairing significantly better than the latter. This is an example of what's known in political science and economics as ""path dependence"".

Tl;dr British colonization was not without long-term benefits and the issue isn't asblack and white ass some people make it seem. If you're interested in this topic and would like more information on the subject, PM me.

&nbsp;

Edit: the project itself sounds interesting. Investigating ""the rights and wrongs of colonialism"", in other words its benefits and failings both instutionally and morally, seems worthwhile. I don't understand why there would be any reason to oppose academic inquiry into the subject. However, I do have concerns about the professor of theology approaching it from a Christian persperctive, rather than one of objective benefits and failiings.
What's wrong with an investigation? Jesus christ these people hate research and science if there's a potential it'll go against their narrative.
“Any attempt to create a ‘balance sheet’ of the good and evil of empire can’t be based on rigorous scholarship.""

Why not?
Had a friend once who was born in Southeast Asia but had also spent time in India before coming to America, and one day out of the blue he said, "" The English, the English at least built schools, hospitals, and taught you things, but the French-- the French gave you shit."" He wasn't speaking from his own memory, of course, and he wasn't politically  sophisticated-- but for that it had the air of the truth.

The legacy of impirialism is a complex and messy subject and is subject to time and interpretation. Full of pros and cons. 

A good example to look at is India. There are many cons. Exploitation of the people and the land, turning the ruling nobility into puppets, thousands dead. But while the infrastructure built under the british (government structure and railways) were purely for resource extraction, but when the British left, they didn't dismantle this infrastructure and the servent class who served the british had an in-depth understanding of this infrastructure and since they didn't decide to wage any wars of revenge against the west India quickly gained access to west-controlled trade routes. 

The legacy of western impirialism is simmilar to the mongols. Some consider the mongol empires to be naught but marauding hordes butchering and raping everyone they came across, other see the Mongols as a force for good, reviving the silk road and connecting much of the world for trade and exchange. Both are correct. 

A simmilar example is Africa although with the opposite results. After decolonization much of Africa descended into chaos and civil wars, genocides and famines despite the infrastructure built by the imperialist europeans still in place such as railroads and cities. And hostility towards the west after the horrors of imperialism cut much of Africa off from international trade, opening the door for foreign powers, fueled by nessecity to fuel their industries, to begin manipulating the African countries to continue resource extraction. 

The fact is, the legacy of imperialism is not black and white. And it may only be fully understood in the centuries to come.

So they oppose a project that looks into the *rights* and *wrongs* because it won't focus purely on the *wrongs*.

Is this really the level of intellectual dishonesty that we want to stoop to in order to preserve a status quo that anything western is horrible?

The critique is nonsense.
>But the signatories to the letter say they are dismayed at the project’s aims, which they say seek to “test the ethical critiques of empire against the historical facts of empire” and develop a “Christian ethic of empire”.

The above claim is entirely baseless. Even if it isn't, they should let the study go through and criticize it's points when it's done.

>“It is our view that the Oxford project – scandalously endorsed by the university – is a highly selective and poisonous political agenda posing as a ‘dispassionate’ examination of the British imperial project.

Just in case you needed further convincing that this is indeed based entirely on a ""politically correct"" approach to academia, and isn't actually rooted in any sort of intellectual tradition.

You know how to deal with people who say things you disagree with? Mind you, I'm not saying Biggar's project has much of a purpose. But you don't tell them to shut up and censor themselves. You listen to what they have to say and then explain exactly how wrong they are.

Man, that is heartwarming...

Two wrongs don't make a right, and it's great to see that after all the political BS this year we have a government that is trying to make things right again. 
I remember reading a while ago the farms went to shit when they kicked all the owners out.   They had the skill and knowledge to run the farms well.  The political buddy's did not.  It caused a good deal of famine. 
That's good.Not that he'll be any better than Mugabe, most information points towards him being a different version of the same brand. Not only that it's not like Smart was a regular Rhodie who was forced off his land, he was apparently pro-guerrilla in the Bush war. Not sure a White Rhodesian who was pro-govt and then forced of their land will be given it back anytime soon.

The attitude of people to White Rhodesians and White South Africans has been very hypocritical. Racism and generalization towards them is common from the same people who say you can't generalize about muslims or black Americans. 
I miss the Rhodesia of my youth!
Ironic how this contrasts with South Africa recently moving towards allowing state seizure of land into its constitution

Fighting for gay rights in relatively homophobe countrys is certainly not helped by the use of a rainbow flag. Former soviet countrys know where identity politics lead to and don't want that stuff back. The aspirations of those equity groups in the west probably burned major bridges in the east. Giving gays rights is one thing, but dealing with demands and baseless alegations after that is nothing anyone would burden itself with.


Because why would you even embolden and strenghten a movement with the aim to disposses you of your humanity because there was a time when you were against them?


Just hope the LGBT in the east are different from those in the west in this regard and make that clear. Otherwise gay rights will go nowhere without external pressure. The number of cameras vs. number of people in the picture tells me they arn't.
Germany needs to centralize the EU, build an army and force these xenophobic countries to open up their borders to diversity. There is no room for hate in the EU.

They can't take off loaded.
B-b-but its a total waste. It can't do anything!!!
How is this a surprise? This is the sole purpose they built those carriers, lol.
I don't get it.  Carriers are power projection tools, and China is mentioned as the main threat.  Japan is already inside of China's ability to hit a ship with a land based missile, and I'd assume close enough to directly launch aircraft from.  So what's the point?  I'd have to assume China is going to watch any Japanese carriers like a hawk and if anything happened they'd be the first to be attacked.  Unless they have effective defenses against surface to sea cruise missiles and subs, just seems useless.  I don't know, I'm not much into naval warfare.  Maybe someone else can explain?  I mean is Japan trying to venture out to other nations or something?
Is this what the whole NK sabre rattling is about? getting east Asian countries to buy more US weapons?

That's kind of not how celebrating Christmas is supposed to work.
The middle east has long been a point of anything but peace to blame and blame and blame anyone else except the participants of all that live there is the fact that none of them get it yet. Brotherly peace and sharing is the answer but no one wants to do that they want to covet all for all and its never going to happen. All those who wish now to continue will die and pass on the hatred to a new generation that will repeat the errors of those before them. All those that say there is a peace process lie or are living a delusion, hearts full of hate cant be peacful. Now you know why Christ came to this place at that time to be born....they should all get the message but they wont. They dont recognize the Prince of Peace, they dont follow Him and they dont know.
Merry Xmas to our Palestinian brother's and sisters, and to you reddit world.

It's probably true though. These two things are not incompatible.

Likewise, US presidents regularly praise, say, the CIA and its agents as true patriots. The CIA's behaviour is incompatible with the idea that most Americans have of what America stands for. Americans think America stands for democracy, liberty, self-determination, etc. But the CIA violates personal liberties, promote islamic terrorism, fascist dictatorships, the use of torture, and actively prevent the self-determination of entire peoples, and so on and so forth. And these people still think themselves patriots, because they don't really believe in any US ""ideals"", only in US ""interests"". And the likes of Snowden who have the opposite attitude (in the NSA this time) are immediately called traitors, *especially* by presidents.

Meanwhile, most Americans, even though they disagree with all these things the CIA does, would think it ridiculous if a US president was criticized for calling CIA agents ""patriots"".

Alternative scenario:

Fine people on both sides
>“Regardless of the historical circumstances, the absolute majority of the people who choose this difficult profession have always been true servants of the state and patriots who went about their duties with dignity and honesty, and placed service to the Fatherland and our people above all else,” Putin said.

>“We remember and will never forget how young men, our comrades-in-arms, rescued hostages, used their bodies to shield people from the bullets of militants, and eliminated terrorists, which they continue to do to this day,” Putin said.

Nothing wrong with saying that.

*The CIA, famed for installing and supporting genocidal dictators across the word, killing millions, was filled with 'True Patriots'.*

Meh. Both sentences can be true. Good people do ugly things, often in the belief it is for a good higher cause.

Is this the definition of fake news, since putin never said that? Misrepresentation of the words and arguments is a brainwashing of own readers
I don't understand... They just opened a memorial dedicated to victims of repressions... 

Also the original [article](https://rg.ru/2017/12/19/aleksandr-bortnikov-fsb-rossii-svobodna-ot-politicheskogo-vliianiia.html) doesn't mention ""true patriots"" (патриот) anywhere.

Unfortunately, he won't be able to run against Putin because of corruption conviction. Although his supporters argue that this is just a way for Kremlin to remove an opponent from the elections.

Of course, Putin could allow him to run, in order to assert his victory (Putin still has an overwhelming support and would undoubtedly win), but I think Kremlin found it easier to enable Ksenia Sobchak to run and represent the 'liberal opposition' of Russia. She published her presidential program yesterday and it is terrible (in terms of appealing to people). It's main points are about legalisation of same-sex marriages, marijuana, radical rewriting of Constitution, prohibition of justification of Stalin's repressions and repeated referendum in Crimea. Though in my (liberal) opinion most of these are good things, they are not nearly the main issues we need to address today and Russia is far from the point of accepting these. Her program just further antagonizes people masses towards the Kremlin's opposition. Now state media has a new possibility to talk how the main goals of oppisition are not removal of corruption, introducing democracy and repairing stagnated economy, but making Russian youth same-sex loving junkies.

It's all incredibly sad, really.

Wow KD just died last night too🤔
The illness is called Snake Fungal Disease (SFD), and it’s caused by a fungus called Ophidiomyces ophidiodiicola which causes painful **legions** on the skin of the snakes it infects. Some snakes can molt to remove the fungus, others aren’t so lucky.

New year calendars recently published in North Korea make no mention of leader Kim Jong-un's birthday, six years after he rose to power.

The birthday of Mr Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, is celebrated on 16 February every year as the Day of the Shining Star; while his grandfather Kim Il-sung's birthday on 15 April is marked as the Day of the Sun.

Both of these national holidays were established while the Kim ancestors were still alive, but it is unknown why North Korea has still not publicly confirmed Kim Jong-un's birthday or marked the day as a public holiday.

> Both of these national holidays were established while the Kim ancestors were still alive

1968 (oeader since 1948) and 1982 (leader since 1994, however was part of the North Korean political life since 1974).

So the answer is, they simply haven’t made it a national holidays yet.
He was never born?!

A report to the on-going session of the standing committee of Chinas largely rubber stamp parliament said the authorities had targeted pornography and violence in their sweeps of websites, blogs and social media accounts, Xinhua said.

Internet security concerns the partys long-term hold on power, the countrys long-term peace and stability, socio-economic development and the peoples personal interests, Xinhua said.

Many of the 100 other current and former Vice employees interviewed by the Times agreed that sexual misconduct  including unwanted kissing, groping, lewd remarks, and propositions for sex  at the company was widespread for years and that top executives did little about it.

Except for a grocery at the ground floor and the business outsourcing company at the top floor, the shopping areas were still closed to the public when the fire started mid-morning, preventing a bigger tragedy amid the peak Christmas shopping season.

I can't find the exact sales data on the VW e-Golf for December, but considering that it has to be below 740 Tesla now is at least 200 cars in the lead for the 2017 total in full-electric car sales
Some people would say we are not adopting electric cars fast enough, but it still amazes me how quickly we went from almost no electric cars to them being pretty common.

In 2007 I don't even remember anyone mentioning them; I can totally imagine that in 2027 fossil fuel cars will be in the minority.
My dad lives in Oslo and tells me about how gasoline car owners get billed simply for driving on the road. Also that there is free parking for electric cars and free charging stations. Not to mention gas prices there are very high.
[Norway's Atlantic Road](https://i.imgur.com/HvSQp6U.jpg)
Vice made a short-documentary on this as I remember. The sales are higher because Norway provides a higher subsidy on electric cars.
Does anyone know why there are so many more cars registered in March, June, September and December (the last month of each quarter) compared to the other months?
So much for the myth that electric cars won't work in winter conditions.

Why don't we see the reverse in majority Christian countries where Muslims are a minority? People being run over and constant terrorist attacks either being carried out or stopped by intelligence.

This is why I don't believe the ""persecuted Muslims"" myth as a reason for their violence. Islam is a hateful ideology that is unkind to every place it spreads.

In 7 years it has only gone up by 2,200? With the tories in power that is staggeringly not as bad as you’d expect 
Don't worry, once May brings in the £1000 begger fines we'll soon see a sharp decline in homelessness.
Can anyone think of a genuine solution to these?

Many are now addicted to spice and other cheap drugs including booze.

So besides just housing them, is treatment a way to go alongside? How do you stop these people fucking up an opportunity to get better as some really do, otherwise are questionable.
Want to see a real homeless problem? Go to southern California. It's beyond shameful that this is happening.
[deleted]
There is a culture and attitude that presenting as homeless is a way to beat council social housing waiting lists. 

Because it does to some extent. 

This is because the Homeless Act gives rights to households found to be homeless and these rights include a guaranteed offer of housing.

So people in difficult housing situations who have a great need will in many cases engineer that into homelessness or will present as such. While some of this will be found out, it's worth noting that many won't as the decisions on homelessness aren't made in courts. 

So the numbers rise.

It's also worth knowing that the local government has an obligation to house under the law. So those sleeping rough are most likely to be people who have been evicted from homeless accomodation (behaviour, criminal activity, drugs) or have made themselves intentionally homeless (non payment of rent, which is crazy given that Housing Benefit exists). While I would hate to see anyone sleep outside especially in winter just remember that they most likely put themselves there by being unable to maintain some basic standards of society.

Now people might say what about those that are mentally ill. Well those people would be classed as vulnerable and under choice they could be protected by social services. 

In short. Don't just blame governments for more people on the streets. The people sadly share the blame.

[deleted]
I lived in japan for a time, and my boss tried to reason that in the Japanese ocean there were too many whales and it was necessary for them to be fished. The misinformation about it is rampant over there, and the global position on this is generally not recognized with many people
Just as an aside, screw Paul Watson. That guy defends tree spiking and is an asshole. 
Good, the sea shephard is a fucking mockery of conservation.

It's not the Sea Shepherd that lost, it's the wildlife in the Southern Ocean that lost.
Japanese whaling is one of the best issues to show how uninformed people can be while still holding a strong opinion.  Every time it comes up the same incorrect points are made. 

You can still be against whaling (I am) but if your arguments hinge on these then you just come across as ignorant:   



1. Japan might have the worst PR team (or not West friendly) of the bunch but they aren't the only nation to hunt whales and they don't hunt the most.  Singling them out (the monthly reddit threads here) seems kinda suspect imo.  

2. The whales they primarily hunt are Minke whales.   They hunt Southern Minke which do not have an endangerment classification but its clear their population is in the hundreds of thousands and whaling is likely negligible.  Northern Minke are more studied and are in the same classification as humans.  

3.  There aren't many endangered whales caught.  Your looking at a few endangered whales per year. 18 Fin whales and 55 sperm whales from 1988-2013 in catches.  Negligible amounts with little/no impact on population.  

4. Japan is hunting under the guise of ""scientific research"" because they signed a treaty that was then changed from the agreed conditions (although partly Japan's fault for being greedy).  They never promised to ban whaling permanently, only temporarily.  People call it dishonest but they didn't sign it with the intention of abusing the loophole. Not to mention protest nations (many are landlocked) hijacked a lot of the legal bodies involved.  Its kinda silly when Luxembourg joins a whaling group and gets a vote.  



There are plenty of points to still use against Japanese whaling or just whaling.  Whales being intelligent, method of killing, Japan hunting close to other peoples territory, ""accidental"" bi-catch of vulnerable species, lack of domestic demand, continuation out of pride not necessity, scale of the hunts, ect.  

So if you are going to argue against it please get the basic facts right because there is a strong argument to be made but it really makes reddit look like a bunch of idiots when the top comment is about how Japan is ""wiping out whole species"" like [one of the last threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7fze00/australian_footage_of_japanese_whaling_was_deemed/) that I saw here.
So what is the military hardware?  Radar?  Satellites?  Airborne radar platforms?  I am confused why the article did not specify that information since it was specifically mentioned.  
Uh oh. Looks like the Sea Shepherd crew will have to finally get real jobs.

I'm really pissed about this as an Arab atheist 
Speaking as an exMuslim, atheism is often seen as worse than one of the greatest, most unforgiveable sins of shirk/associating others with the one God, Allah. 

With shirk, you are saying there are other gods like Allah, or that Allah has a son, etc and that is unforgiveable in Islam. 

But with atheism, you deny Allah all together.

Thats part of the reason why Islam has death for apostasy.

https://sunnah.com/bukhari/88/5

>Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to `Ali and he burnt them. The news of this event, reached Ibn `Abbas who said, ""If I had been in his place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade it, saying, 'Do not punish anybody with Allah's punishment (fire).' **I would have killed them according to the statement of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), 'Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'""**

Now some liberal Muslims might claim that actual sentencing on apostasy is very uncommon, but thats misleading as 

1. mob violence like the Bangladesh bloggers being hacked to death

2. Its still not safe for most people in most of the Muslim world to come out as atheists. Yes, the rich/liberal Muslims on reddit can drink and host gay parties but they don't represent the majority.

This is by design - making terrorists is necessary to make good money at making things that kill terrorists. 
I wonder if civilians living in these area call Americans terrorist when bombs from the USA  blow up schools or homes or public areas. It's kinda strange since then both sides would be calling each other terrorist and the war against terrorism would be nothing more than a war on themselves.
And all those victims will have relatives that will be more than willing to join the *next* war against the great satan.
Not to be insensitive, but I feel like 1 civilian killed in every 5 air strikes still doesn’t add up to a lot compared to past wars. The coalition has conducted a little over 28,000 air strikes, which would mean about 5,600 civilian deaths. If you look at WW2, there were around 50 million civilians killed. Vietnam has almost 2 million in both sides. The Korean War killed 2.7 million citizens. No deaths are good, but I’d say that less than 6,000 deaths is a hell of a lot better than in the millions.

That's not an apology. It could be called a non-apology apology, but even that would be generous.
>I made certain remarks in 2015 and regret the exchange during the Nieuwsuur interview

That's not really the issue. What's telling in this *apology* is that it's beating around the bush. To further his agenda he willfully lied about islamic terrorism in the Netherlands. Cars and politicians were supposedly set ablaze and there supposedly are no-go zones here. None of those facts are true.

How about apologizing for those statements and while you're at it, retract those words alltogether. 
I can't help wonder how the Dutch feel about this. The USA has, as its primary representative to them, a man who flat out knowingly lied to their faces.

If Trump keeps this man in place, he's basically telling the Dutch he doesn't care a damn about what they think.

Nice touch.
Same ambassador an hour later: ""I didn't apologise!"" 
Some of Roger Stone's rules:

* ""Admit nothing, deny everything, launch counterattack.""
* ""Attack, attack, attack, never defend.""
* ""Hit it from every angle. Open multiple fronts on your enemy. He must be confused, and feel besieged on every side."" 

Incase you weren't aware, Roger Stone has been advising Trump for many years. The Netflix documentary [""Get Me Roger Stone""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IPyv4KgTAA) is a ripper!
America, please stop exporting your politicians. Ours are already bad enough, no need to make it even worse.

Well, stop dealing coke to the president and perhaps you won't have this problem.
President Peña Nieto has been a political corpse since Ayotzinapa case. His party robbed elections in the most populated Mexican state this year with an indecent amount of money from the federal and local governments but, of course, it was an exemplary election, a clean democratic exercise, as always.

Several analysts think it was a ""lab test"" for next year's presidential election. They, one year before assume power, are wasting people's money on stupid spots trying to gain attention from electorate, including leftist (but not so) Lopez Obrador. The train of violence seems infinite for us, mexicans, and it is not only violence, we live in poverty, with a rather weak law enforcement, with a ridiculously inefficient justice system, education is basically a headache for politicians, they don't respect nor promote education and corruption is a matter of every day, every hour.

The new law for internal security is the last nail of the coffin. We'll be able to protest but they'll be able to send the army against us.
The thing is Mexico is in an excellent geographical position. It has a bunch of natural resources. Great people and a lot of potential. Politicians ruin it. 
I am a Mexican and I don't understand why being a Mexican means that I have to hate Trump or his proposed border wall and love illegal immigrants, let me tell you that before he ran for president, people here used to make fun of illegal immigrants all the time, but now it is not okay. Donald never attacked the Mexican people nor Latin Americans, he only attacked illegal immigrants saying things that are true, he said that they are not the best Mexico has to offer, which is true, because the best in Mexico work hard and stay in this country or immigrate LEGALLY to a developed country!

It's funny because when Calderon was president, he was heavily criticize that his presidential term was full of blood and murder in the war against cartels. I remember Televisa mentioning this every single day with headlines of ""Today X number of people were murdered"", etc.

Then, Peña Nieto came into power and Televisa went silent. Everyone just thought he ended the war because there were no more headlines. The reality is that it's been the same or even worse than before. As for the news? They shut down ""Joaquin Lopez Doriga"" news show which was basically all the news that happened during the day. 

What do we get to replace that? ""10 en punto"" with Denise Maerker which was just awful.  Instead of covering the daily news, they focused on really specific stories. (It was basically a one-hour long segment that she had with Lopez Doriga in which the focus  was on stories that required attention). It's gotten a little bit better, but I still feel Televisa and the government are intentionally leaving us in the dark. To the point that satire shows like: ""El pulso de la republica"" are a better source for the weekly news.

>Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 pledging to tame the violence that escalated under his predecessor Felipe Calderon. **He managed to reduce the murder tally during the first two years of his term**, but since then it has risen steadily.

More like: ""He managed to convince Televisa and every other outlet to avoid covering the news that might impact his image"". Something that no longer works with the amount of violence going on. They can no longer control it.

I have no hope for the presidential elections 2018. Here in Mexico we laughed at Trump, but we also have or own wanna-be Trump in the name of ""Lopez Obrador"". The kind of person that yells what the people want to hear. All of this is giving fuel to Lopez Obrador to the point that he might actually win next years election. 


Mexico is such a shithole thanks to their politicians. They really need to stop getting butt hurt cause we don't want their immigrants and fix their country so their won't be any.

Wondering if thede were the same officials who said that Flynn was going to testify that Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians, or the official who reported that national guards would assist ICE in rounding up illegal immigrants.
At no point did someone sitting nearby say 'What are you talking about, Nigeria is one of the most modern, developed countries in Africa.' Nigeria's biggest problem is the deforestation exploitation industry iirc. He's never going to stop this serial behavior until someone on his side corrects him when he's wrong. EDIT: in 2014 it overtook SA to have the largest economy in Africa at 500b GDP.
Had a *very* good friend from Nigeria throughout middle/ high school. Family all wicked smart and driven, very succesful. 

I remember he basically taught me a lot about real life (indirectly, which is the best way really). I mentioned how his house was really fucking nice once, and he got irritated and said ""the nice house doesn't mean we make ends meet easily, we still struggle in many ways."" I was maybe 13 and already learning the real life meaning of ""don't judge a book by it's cover"". 

What I'm trying to say is, Trump aside, there ARE people who believe those type of comments. I feel blessed to have met such a wonderful Nigerian family, and I feel enlightened just having known them. 


This guys mouth is just a human sewer pipe. He really should teach his arse  to talk. I honestly think there would be more sense from he's farts. A definitive example of a borderline moron.  
Those immigrants are probably richer than Donald Trump is, not being billions in the hole.
Canadians make Canada what it is, and Haitians make Haiti what it is.

Haiti is a terrible country, it s hard to blame a developed country for not wanting their country to become more like Haiti.

US only pays lipservice to its regional poodle India by mentioning him. In reality, they only care about figures and groups which are perceived to affect Afghanistan. There won't be any raid over this guy. Besides, our air force chief has said US drones may be shot down from now on. So any helicopters violating Pak airspace again will definitely be shot down.

Remember when Sweden was being vocal about accepting unlimited numbers of refugees? And when they had to backpedal and the deputy pm of the green party [cried in a press conference](https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/nov/24/asa-romson-sweden-deputy-prime-minister-cries-announcing-refugee-u-turn-video)? Reality is tough for all of us

The worst part of this is that she's still trying to frame this as ""refugees will be better off if they go somewhere else"" and not ""we will be better off if refugees go somewhere else"".

Is anyone going to tell Sweden, or the right for that matter, that you can, in fact, deport refugees either for crimes or when the situation improves? I do not think Asylum status should ever be permanent except under special circumstances. Instead we should start thinking about repatriation, and we *can* repatriate.

[There are currently 21,693 Iraqi refugees in Sweden right now.](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=UNHCR&f=indID%3aType-Ref%3basyID%3aswe%3boriID%3airq%3byr%3a2015%2c2016&c=0,1,2,3,4,5,6&s=yr:desc,asyEngName:asc,oriEngName:asc&v=1) The war in Iraq is right now, ending. We can send back the Kurdish population and the Shia, as well as some of the Sunni in areas. We can offer them some money to do so to cover the costs of repatriation under the condition they leave willingly. Otherwise, they don't get the money. Germany is doing this already with their failed refugees.

Now here's the unpopular part: I do not believe we can return Syrian refugees just yet. There are people who have returned, the issue is however that those who *do* return, if caught by Syrian Government forces, [get tortured and/or forced to join the Syrian Government Army.](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/road-to-damascus-the-syrian-refugees-who-want-to-go-home-1.3309941) and therein liesthe problem: to end the Refugee Crisis we must end the Syrian civil war, and although peacetalks are ongoing, I think it's likely we won't see an end until Assad wins or the peace talks somehow, make a breakthrough (hint: they won't). If I were Sweden, I would take a more heavy handed ""stick"" approach and start taking away benefits if they don't learn Swedish or take integration classes. Once the war is over, then start repatriations.

Repatriations **if the country's situation changes** shouldn't be too much of an issue in the case of Syrians, as [most Syrians want to return.](https://www.ictj.org/sites/default/files/ICTJ_Report_Syria_NotWithoutDignity.pdf) Figures range from [82% in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan](https://www.dailysabah.com/syrian-crisis/2017/09/08/un-majority-of-syrian-refugees-want-to-return-home). For European refugees [that number is 94%](https://www.newsdeeply.com/refugees/community/2017/06/13/understanding-what-syrian-refugees-want). It's clear, if we are going to stop the refugee crisis, we need to stop the Syrian Civil War.

EDIT: updated figures and article.
This whole situation is much more complex than it seems.  Be careful not to jump to overly-easy conclusions.

Back in 2016, I had an afternoon to read through several very troubling/concerning/thought-provoking articles that detailed the refugee situation in Sweden & Germany (Calais, etc.)

On one hand, Americans would simply not believe the incredible lengths to which the European countries went to accommodate and try to help out.  ...They are so much more progressive and compassionate than we are that it's almost incomprehensible (by our standards).  ...There were all sorts of reasons why.  Google-up a couple of articles and see for yourself all the work that was done for integration & social services, etc.

-----
However, the other side was that a lot (most?) of these efforts also had various economic-type goals.  For instance, since the European population (like ours), is aging and declining slowly, they need younger workers, etc. etc.  ...Well, a lot of the integration programs fed or funneled many of the refugees & asylum seekers into the places you might expect.  ...This is actually common for all such migration events.  Just consider how immigrants have been treated in the U.S. for decades and you can see plenty of parallels.

Worse -- and perhaps dealbreaking -- in times of economic stress, not to mention ""austerity"", people generally start to look more inwards, so to speak, and are less accommodating to outsiders.  ...Xenophobia, ethno-centrism, and all of that are spreading rapidly across Europe, and they are already somewhat more in that mode than we are as a ""melting pot"" here in the U.S.

-----
In short, despite a vast effort for integration, the likes of which is simply unimaginable to us in the U.S., much of this isn't working, and the disfunction is being used as a political wedge-issue by the unscrupulous.  ...The whole thing is leading to neo-Nazi's and worse.  The phrase ""powder keg"" is in the air in very concerning ways once again, and very few are taking the time to understand a lot of the deep-seated, racial, ethnic, & economic issues (which lastly, we in the U.S. bear a lot of responsibility for instigating around the Middle East, etc. in the first place).

>Andersson told newspaper Dagens Nyheter that Sweden's housing and teacher shortages mean the country should not receive more asylum seekers than it can integrate. Refugees would be better off, she said, applying for asylum elsewhere.

Good. The majority of beggars have homes and are making a conscious decision not to work, because they know that if you're good at panhandling you can make upwards of $40,000 a year.

In my time homeless I only met a very small number of beggars that legitimately needed the assistance. Most had extreme disabilities, and the rest had extreme illnesses that prevented them from working.

Surveys have been done in many cities in the US (I'm not sure on the rest of the world but I'd assume EU is similar) that found only one in ten panhandlers were actually homeless.

Don't enable them. If you want to help others that need it, find a good charity or someone that's clearly injured. Stop enabling alcoholism and drug addictions.

How do you ban begging? Are you going to lock all the beggars in prison? How long are you going to lock them up in prison? 1 day? 1 week? 1 year? After they are released from prison and they become beggars again, what do you do? Lock them up in prison again? You will never stop begging because they will always return to begging.

Trophy hunting is a controversial hobby. If it is to ever end, many of these conservations will need to find ways to make up the revenue that is lost from the trophy hunting. 
You need to be pretty stupid to believe that hunting endangered animals is beneficial to their survival.

But this is the same bullshit american politicians use to justify to brainless voters unpopular decisions just like trickle-down economy, the non existence of the global warming, the existence of Iraqi mass-destruction weapons...  I could go on for days.

The fact is that ""big game hunters"" are rich people, plain and simple. And rich people are all American politicians (most of them, at least) care about.

If we really wanted to save the Elephants we would farm them. 
And now cash starved Zimbabwe has lost all incentive to keep Elephants and protect them. I predict most epephanta being killed off to make way for agriculture
This is an arbitrary decision with limited basis in reality.  It's a political answer.  It has been a successful method to allow rich hunters assist with management of the endangered animals.  This assistance is a paid for privilege which gives these programs money they desperately need to help these animals.   

It's easy to say sitting in your warm house.. well just have the game wardens take care of the troublesome animals.  Who pays for the wardens in these poorer countries?  

Instead how about I auction off the privilege to assisting in the killing off of an older elephant who I would have had to kill otherwise?  I will help lead the hunter to the animal.  They are only allowed to hunt this specific one.  It will help our program.  Our program will be able to keep running another six months with this one auction.  That means I can have two more animal biologists join to take care of the ecosystem.

Since the effects of climate change are on a what? 40 year lag? Average foresight for most humans on the planet? maybe a couple of days? Things are going to go into serious shitshow mode.

>In fact, Jakarta is sinking faster than any other big city on the planet, faster, even, than climate change is causing the sea to rise — so surreally fast that rivers sometimes flow upstream, ordinary rains regularly swamp neighborhoods and buildings slowly disappear underground, swallowed by the earth. The main cause: Jakartans are digging illegal wells, drip by drip draining the underground aquifers on which the city rests — like deflating a giant cushion underneath it. About 40 percent of Jakarta now lies below sea level.

>Climate change acts here as it does elsewhere, exacerbating scores of other ills. And in Jakarta’s case, a tsunami of human-made troubles — runaway development, a near-total lack of planning, next to no sewers and only a limited network of reliable, piped-in drinking water — poses an imminent threat to the city’s survival.

Misdirection at its best. Expect Trump to tweet about it soon.
They’re probably just coming out of their closets now. 
I think the game could be to use the jihadi manpower to open a new front against Iran using a cost multiplier model. Foolish jihadis and mercenaries led by a Wahhabi and Western intelligence will be preaching the willing fools to kill and die for all the wrong reasons. Being more fanatic, ISIS will be able to pull recruits away from Taliban, and stop attacks on NATO troops in the region. This will also undermine the control of Pakistan in Afghanistan as Taliban will lose people and power.

Four years too late. Obama and Putin made sure that Ukraine will forever be a buffer zone. The time to act was when Crimea got annexed, Obama was too afraid of providing necessary aid and possibly starting a war with Russia over tiny little Ukraine, so here we are. 

Will Russia try to take more Russian-speaking Ukrainian land? Probably. Will the world actually react to stop them? Probably not. 
2 days ago when this was first coming out people were saying that the lethal weapons were only sniper rifles which Ukraine already has, and implied it was a cover to make it look like the US was providing a lot of lethal aid to throw off the Russian/trump collusion thing.  Wonder how those same people are going to spin it now that missiles are part of the package.

I wonder how Russia will respond. Enhancing Syrian or North Korean defensive capabilities would be a proportional response. 

The decent and cheap thing to do would be to ship grain to North Korea. Russia has an excessive amount of grain to export and North Korea could certainly put that grain to good use. 
There's a good chance that this will also mean javelins falling into Russia's hands. 
r/whatcouldgowrong
An unwise escalation. Putin can always invade and annex the Ukraine. There isn't shit the US can do about that.

Making that option more attractive to him by worsening the status-quo is unwise and excessively risky.

The real surprise is that Russia hasn't annexed the Ukraine and Belarus yet.
Seems like the opposite thing Putin would want his so-called puppet to do. Hmmm...

Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak.”

> Students linked arms but were mown down including soldiers. APCs then ran over bodies time and time again to make 'pie' and remains collected by bulldozer. Remains incinerated and then hosed down drains.

They did all that to democracy.
The original headline makes it clear they are quoting someone.

>Mr Donald's telegram is from 5 June, and he says his source was someone who ""was passing on information given him by a close friend who is currently a member of the State Council"".

The official government death toll was undoubtedly too low. They were using lethal force on multiple fronts to advance into the city. But 10,000 is several thousand higher than most independent estimates settled upon based on all the available information about it. Even most of the people within the Chinese government would not have had access to an accurate accounting of what really happened. A secondhand account from an unnamed official isn't going to be any more reliable than the estimates that emerged later.

Most people involved in the protests were not killed. At their height they were hundreds of thousands strong. Killing on that scale would have been impossible to cover up, even in China. The death toll was a result of brutal measures to break up the protest and drive it off the streets, not to exterminate everyone who had been involved in it.

It doesn't mean the numbers couldn't have reached 10,000. But just because the numbers were covered up doesn't mean the toll was that high. This news story is one new account to weigh against previous accounts suggesting numbers closer to a couple of thousand.

The fact there was a brutal crackdown killing hundreds of people followed by harsh reactionary political measures isn't in dispute. Settling on a death toll is not the heart of why China's government is so sensitive about the event. It frightened them and embarrassed them. They don't want to face that kind of dissent again, or the consequences for their actions.
Holy shit.. that article is NSFW. 

""APCs then ran over bodies time and time again to make 'pie' and remains collected by bulldozer. ""

""Four wounded girl students begged for their lives but were bayoneted.""
I wish america would stand up to china, Trump said he would then bent over like a dog. 
Those were not people they killed but enemies of the nation. See? Makes a big difference now
It didn't happened. China said so.
And then we granted them Most Favored Nation Trading Status.
The details are horrifying. They ran over bodies to turn them into ""pie"" so it could be easily incinerated and drained.

I cannot even imagine the pain the families must have suffered not knowing where the bodies of their loved ones went and to find out this was their demise.

The most incompetent leader should be recognized by Guines World Records asa new category.
Oil accounts for 95% of Venezuela's export revenues. 

Over the recent years as oil prices fell, it seems it took a huge toll on the export revenue, the economy, the country.


According to a US Securities and Exchange Commission’s report the Venezuelan economy collapsed by 16,5% in 2016. The government is not releasing official stats from almost 3 years and this report gives some alarming detail about the condition of the oil-dependent country.


Complete economic turmoil?   That can't be right, I thought Venezuela was the poster child of what a successful socialist country looks like. 
Ahh, Venezuela the shinning example of REAL socialism...bloody rich with natural resources and yet people suffer from hunger and despair...
Never forget!...better dead than red...
This is always going to be the result in a centralized economy. In the labor theory of value, no useful work is done by people whose full-time job is the ownership of the means of production (farmland, in this case). They expected that by seizing farms from farmers and redistributing ownership to the people working those farms, all of the farming work would continue to get done, since the laborers were doing all of the real work already, already knew how to do everything that mattered, and were now more incentivized to work because all of the surplus value would be going into their pockets instead of being stolen by capitalists. This doesn't work out so well because in reality there was an awful lot of work being performed by the former owners that is no longer getting done. Workers theoretically own the farmland, but once the government has shown it is willing to arbitrarily seize and redistribute wealth, new owners know they're vulnerable to the exact same thing happening to them, and are much less willing to make investments that could be arbitrarily seized in the future.
On the upside that’s better than dropping 16.6%
2018 will be an interesting year. We'll see if sh*t finally spreads all over the room or if it'll keep hitting the ceiling fan just like most of 2017.

Good luck to the ears of bats.

How can a renewable energy such as a wind turbine be given a value per KWh? Once the turbine is up, it generates power for free (excluding the minimal maintenance labour) where a coal plant or gas generator requires constant fuel inputs that cost money.

This has never made sense to me and I fell like it is all bullshit. If that generator lasts 20 - 50 years, that number will always be decreasing. 
today i learned cleanliness is measured in a dollar value.
Why not convert all offshore wind to ammonia? Easier to store the energy and no transmission loses. Although there will be loses in it's creation. Hydroelectric dams have been used for decades to make ammonia. High energy density and reasonable commercial yields.

Just to add some context, we got seriously burned by the crisis. Our banking system was tremendously exposed and many big banks were performing criminal activities many of which we still dont fully understand.

 The years of austerity crippled the middle class and did little to actually improve the unemployement rate. Young people were literally told to emmigrate to seek a better future, and lots of us did. 

I dont want to get much into politics but the austerity government led by a right wing coalition had a tough mandate and they would say that things are improving due to budget cuts made during those times. The new power solution that is in place is a whole new thing in the Portuguese political system. Never before has the Communist party, the Left Bloc and the Socialists sat at the same table to make a government viable. This brings a sort of socialist policy to the table that i think eases a little the burden of the tax reforms. There is a sort of new found confidence that we can kinda see daily as businesses are settling in and workforce is seeked. A lot of precarious contracts are still being signed and that is a horrible deal that allows companies to pay much less social security at the expense of honest working people. 

The state sector is still enormous and i believe it has to shrink further because there are many many useless positions being filled by people that happen to belong to Party A or Party B and many other levels of corruption.

The path to the future is bright but we tend to be suspicious about it because as seen previously weve broken many light bulbs before

This deficit doesn't mean shit when there are payments being deliberately delayed so as to make these numbers. Without getting into it, just know that there are thousands of people getting literally zero help after having their houses burned down from this summers fires, and being told otherwise, also, underfunded education and health system among many other things.

I don't like getting political on the internet but my (and a bunch of other peoples) opinion is that this government are a bunch of brats making basically the same policies as the previous one under different measures and throwing sand in the voters eyes.

Marriage has almost always been about consolidating wealth. This is nothing new in many ways.
Cutting to the issue of 'family means blood relations' and 'love means sex'.  The issue in the story is how true those things are and whether the tax loopholes for family/marriage are valid in the first place.

Maybe not a civil union or a marriage, but I like the idea of best friends having a ceremony similar to a civil union, just not legal.  Friendships hard, we need more traditional celebratory activities that are about the friendship, not just with friends for something else.  All I'm saying is I liked the story.

> When NATO's Nuclear Planning Group assembles, the highest level of classification is applied: ""Cosmic Top Secret."" Even defense ministers from the alliance are required to turn in their mobile phones before entering the small, windowless meeting room at NATO's headquarters in Brussels. Aside from the ministers, only a few advisers are allowed in.
> 
> 
> A frequent participant describes the atmosphere in the nuclear meetings as reverential. It's ""almost like in a church,"" he says. There's no chumminess on display and no jokes are made. ""The focus is on nuclear deterrence, the holy grail of the alliance, in a manner of speaking,"" says another military man. ""Everybody keeps a straight face and sits up straight.""
> 
> Such was the atmosphere four weeks ago when the group gathered to hear carefully prepared remarks from U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis. He had shared material with alliance partners through their intelligence agencies - and that material was enough to ensure that the meeting would be a sensitive one. According to evidence gathered by U.S. intelligence, Russia is in the process of secretly deploying nuclear-armed medium-range ballistic missiles.
> 
> The comments Mattis delivered in the meeting pertained to an issue that the U.S. has been concerned about for several years. For some time, Washington has believed that Russia is in violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty), which bans medium-range nuclear missiles. **With the help of satellite imagery, the U.S. believes it is able for the first time to prove that Moscow has developed a new ground-launched, nuclear-capable cruise missile known as the SSC-8. Washington claims to have observed at least two operational units outfitted with the cruise missiles.**
> 
> ...
> 
> **Washington has now issued its allies an ultimatum: By the alliance summit in the summer of 2018, Mattis said at the recent top-secret meeting in Brussels, NATO must find a common position on forcing the Russians to return to INF Treaty compliance, with coercion if necessary.** Should NATO prove unable to agree on a course of action including possible punitive measures, the United States, Mattis threatened, would push ahead on its own. ""What it would mean for the U.S. to go it alone under a White House led by Donald Trump is something nobody wants to think about,"" said one NATO diplomat.
> 
> Not all alliance members agree, however, that sufficient proof exists of Russia's alleged violation of the treaty. To protect their own sources and methods, the Americans declined to share all the details, even with their closest allies. In the meeting, Mattis pointed out that other NATO member states have also obtained intelligence pertaining to the Russian developments, something Lithuanian Defense Minister Raimundas Karoblis confirmed in comments to DER SPIEGEL. ""Russian deployment of intermediate-range missiles in violation of the INF Treaty has been confirmed by the Allied intelligence sources,"" he said in a statement.
> 
> The German government considers the U.S. intelligence material to be credible but that final proof is still lacking, said a source in Berlin. ""We take the indications of a possible violation extremely seriously,"" says German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen. She says it is primarily up to Russia to ""clear up the doubts about its adherence to the treaty in dialogue with the U.S. and NATO.""
> 
> ...
> 
> **It is known that the Russians have modified a sea-launched system and tested it on land. That would be prohibited under the INF Treaty, but only if the missile tested was able to fly further than 500 kilometers. That, though, is the claim the U.S. is making, and it has presented information that allegedly backs up that claim. With the help of satellite imagery, for example, the U.S. believes it has determined how large the new, nuclear-armed missiles are. And the formula has long been: The longer the cruise missile used, the further it can fly.**
> 
> ...
> 
> For several months, a ""non-paper"" has been circulating among member states in which more than three dozen responses to a possible treaty violation are listed. The more moderate responses are marked in green while the more severe are in orange. Among the latter are such measures as a higher level of readiness, a more frequent rotation of nuclear-capable B-2 bombers or an upgrade of NATO's missile defense systems.
> 
> But it is the red-marked options toward the end of the paper that read like horror scenarios to many Europeans. One option calls for the U.S. to develop new medium-range missiles itself. For the missiles to have the desired deterrent effect on Russia, though, they would have to be stationed in Europe - just like during the Cold War. A joint signal needs to be sent that a Russian violation of the treaty comes with a military price, says an adviser to Mattis in Brussels. It would be the beginning of a new arms race.
> 
>  
> ...
> 
> 
> 
> **It is known, though, that the Russians have asked Washington several times since 2005 about jointly agreeing to withdraw from the INF Treaty. Their argument: It only applies to the two former superpowers and not to those in Russia's immediate neighborhood like China or Pakistan. The Americans have always said no.**
> 
> ...
> 
> 
> That is why the German government is showing extreme care on the issue. This week, the Americans had wanted to see the NATO council issue a statement including a sharp rebuke of Russia for breaching the INF Treaty. But Berlin took the lead in ensuring that the alliance did not adopt an official position on the issue. And the statement ended up in the garbage bin.
> 
> 
So Russia developed medium range nuclear missiles, that are illegal, to counter anti ballistic missile technology deployed by the US nullifying their advantage. 

Russia will never start a nuclear war nor invade the Baltic states and Nato will not attack Russia nor retake Crimea, so business as usual?

I really hope Mattis doesn't share details or strategy with Trump (Mr Kompromat) or anyone the latter has access to. And I'm glad Bannon is off the NSC. I'm surprised this actually sounds like an adult handling of the situation so far... The US has fallen so low from leadership, and Germany is becoming an unpredicted leader in all this
Isint the treaty only supposed to affect ballistic missles ans not cruise?
I swear this is an act I believe all three super powers have quite a close relationship
Ok then. So a US general goes in front of his foreign allies, finds a boogie man, and voila! American weapons companies will undoubtedly have the newest, spiffiest tech to ~~bankrupt~~ supply her allies with, while only demanding modest cuts to social programmes. It's not as if Trumps only foreign policy successes so far have all been selling guns. /s
Russia takes action against NATO deployment of ABM systems that can also fire nuclear tipped missiles if need be, which is a VIOLATION of the treaty YET RUSSIA IS SOMEHOW BEING AGGRESSIVE HERE

Let's not forget Putin is also watching and not wanting a pro US ally on his border. Putin has openly said he would use nukes for offensive purposes. He had nuke bombers in the air and armed missles ready to support his forces when taking Crimea.

Can someone ELI5 this:

> In addition, the tax reform reportedly includes a change to the way capital investment such as machinery, but not buildings, are accounted for. Under current law, 50 percent of the investment can be deducted immediately and the rest has to be written off over a number of years. Now, all of the investment will be able to be deducted in the year in which it occurs, while Germany still spreads out the deduction over a period of years.
It is unlikely US companies will be able to expand by cutting taxes. Europe is a very mature market and European companies already saturated that market. There is no room for US companies to expand into that market. If US cuts taxes to attract companies to go to US, EU will give benefits to European companies so that they can keep US out of the European market. In the end, no jobs will be move to US because US cannot expand to the European market.

Then maybe Germany needs to reform their taxes. Is each countries priority not their own economy? Why should the US have high taxes to their own detriment? Because others want theirs to be lower? Especially given the fact that there are nations in the EU that will still have a lower tax rate even after this tax plan. For example, Ireland. Which has taken American businesses due to this. All sounds a bit hypocritical. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

By taking artificial measures such as cutting taxes will not create jobs. There will be no job boom in US. Other countries will take appropriate measures to counteract the tax cut.

I am in Japan and have two children. There are some great benefits given here.  
My wife sent one week in the hospital after giving birth with round the clock care and a single room cost $3500 US and then $3000 came back in cash after a month.  Children have free medical care and medicine too.   As an American I couldn’t believe it!  Really we paid $900 for a dog and only got it that cheap because of my mother in law being friends of the owner.  
On the flip side kids cost a lot in other areas and I have to work so much I almost never get to see them.  Other things like a house, cars, any kind of trip, eating out if you want and taxes even paying for god awful NHK tv take almost everything away.  
Then you have to look at what married life is like here.  Japanese women make great girlfriends but after marriage things start getting colder and then add children into the mix and you have the answer to global warming.  
>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to resolve the dual challenges of the country’s aging population and declining birth rate by increasing support for child care and education, while his government has set a goal of raising the total fertility rate to 1.8 by around 2025.

I like this attitude. Their first response is to encourage births among the people already in Japan. 

In Western Europe the first response is to bring in the next generation from Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea without any thought to the potential problems such a policy causes. 
But then who produce the anime!?
I propose paying people to have children in countries with extremely low birth rates. The problem is that the labor costs of raising children has been devalued so much that stay at home mothers are looked down upon and seen as doing nothing to contribute to society, unlike working adults. These countries will have to choose if they need more children badly enough that they're willing to put some of the tax dollars brought in through work into paying parents to raise the next generation of their country 

You don't want to create a situation where incentives are created for *neither* parent to work and just live off government money, but in order to keep fertility rates up the great costs of having children to working parents has to be offset somehow.
[deleted]
Japan needs a dramatic cultural shift towards valuing families and family time and not just ""work work work"" if they want to slow down their negative fertility rate.
Good, everyone should follow in their footsteps, having children in this modern times have no value. They are a really unnecessary expense, i would rather spend that money on something useful. 
Good.  There are too many people.  Every country should follow suit.
Me, too.

So are they training for those specific conditions?
Is it really shocking that Russia has a plan for invading the Baltic states? I can bet my ass that all major powers have military plans for war with their neighbors.

Hell, the U.S had a plan in place for war with U.K and how to invade Canada during the 1930s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Plan_Red
Isn’t this what North Korea complains about when US & SK does their drills?
Why can't we all just be friends?
I'm no fan of Russia, but I doubt they would actually go through with it. Sure, Georgia and Ukraine happened but those countries weren't part of NATO or the EU. Both countries were also in a kind of tug of war between Russia and the West before the conflicts. This was still a military exercise after all.

I really don't see what Russia would gain from invading the Baltic states now, especially with the risks involved. Sure, there are big Russian minorities in Estonia and Latvia but that doesn't mean a conflict will automatically happen. 
People who believed this also believed that Jade Helm was an exercise to impose martial law on the USA.

So basically an oil embargo, a requirement to stop any ships to/from N Korea that could have illegal materials on them, bans on a variety of material imports/exports and all countries using N Korean labor have to send them back within 12 months.

If I'm not mistaken, isn't their a precedent of someone getting attacked every time oil is fucked with?
I am sure Kim Jung will think over this seriously and realize how he has been wrong all this time. That or it might make about as much difference as a fart in the wind. 
I find it very odd that Russia and China didn’t use their UNSC positions to block this. After all, they’ve helped DPRK get where it is now.
